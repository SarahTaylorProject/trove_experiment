This repository contains two folders with experimental scripts.
Both make use of randomness and interesting sources.

## Digital Death Trip

As featured in the Digital Death Trip podcast instalments, the Digital Death Trip script is an homage to "Wisconsin Death Trip", and a (dark) exploration of the historical events we often have collective amnesia about. 

"Tragedy" is a popular euphemism for violence. These tragedies tend to generate a spot of news coverage and horror, then collective amnesia. The randomness of a script is better suited to searching these than humans. 


## Poetry Mashup

The poetry mashup folder includes scripts to generate random poetry.

The scripts use variations on the following sources:
- the Bible API
- the Online Poetry database API
- text files
- random words from Python Natural Language Tool Kit
