Bates.</span></p> <p><span>  Wilganan  belohged  to  the  great  Bib</span><span>  bulinun  race  of  the  south-west  corner  of</span><span>  Australia,  descendants  of  the  first  hordes</span><span>  that  entered  Australia  from  the  north  in  a</span><span>  dim  past  age.  At  the  period  of  white</span><span>  settlement  the  Bibbulmun  territory  ex</span><span>  tended  from  Jurien  Bay  (1st.  29deg.,  long.</span><span>  115deg.)  to  EsperanceBay  (lat.  34deg.,  long.</span></p> <p><span>  122deg.)\u2014a  vast  and  fertile  area  of!</span><span>  which  the  richness  of  soil,  long  length  of</span><span>  sea  coast,  abundant  rivers  and  lakes,  andj</span><span>  great  wooded  hills  and  valleys  afforded  an</span><span>  unfailing  supply  of  foods  at  all  seasons  of</span></p> <p><span>  the  year.  ]</span></p> <p><span>  There  were  two  great  social  divisions  in</span><span>  this  group\u2014phratnes  scientists  love  to</span><span>  call  them\u2014Manitchmat  (white  cockatoo)</span></p> <p><span>  and  IVordungmat  (crow,  'mat\"  means'</span><span>  stock,  leg,  branch,  Ac.\u2014and  every  member  ]</span></p> <p><span>  of  the  Bibbulmun  race  entered  by</span><span>  birth  into  one  or  other  of  these  1</span><span>  divisions.  Upon  these  two  main  divi-1</span><span>  sions  their  entire  social  system  hung.</span></p> <p><span>  Wordungmat  married  Manitchmat  and;</span><span>  vice  versa,  and  any  branch  of  this  law</span><span>  meant  death,  for  all  Manitchmat  were</span><span>  blood  relations  to  each  other,  and  could</span><span>  not  intermarry.  Similarly,  Wordungmat</span><span>  could  not  marry  among  themselves.  There</span><span>  were  two  forms  of  descent  amongst  this</span><span>  great  group  of  peoples\u2014paternal  and</span><span>  maternal\u2014the  line  of  demarcation  between</span><span>  them  being  somewhere  about  lat.  Sfdeg.</span></p> <p><span>  This  difference  in  descent  confined  mar</span><span>  riages  amongst  the  two  groups  north  and</span><span>  aoutli  of  this  latitude  to  their  respective</span><span>  areas.  South  of  lat.  Stdeg.  a  Manitchmat</span><span>  man  had  Mauitcbmat  children;  north  of</span><span>  this  latitude  the  children  of  a  Manitchmat</span><span>  entered  his  wife's  division,  and  were  Wor</span><span>  dungmat.  Yet,  notwithstanding,  this  differ</span><span>  ence  in  descent,  each  group  followed  the</span><span>  ancient,  simple,  and  universal  marriage</span><span>  laws  wherein  only  fathers'  sisters'  sons  and</span><span>  daughters  married  mothers*  brothers'</span><span>  daughters  and  sons.  These  were  the  only</span><span>  legal  marriages  in  all  tribes.  The  two</span><span>  forms  of  descent  prevailing  amongst  the</span><span>  Bibbulmun  peoples  kept  the  northern  and</span><span>  southern  groups  apart  from  each  other  as</span><span>  far  as  marriages  between  them  were  con</span><span>  cerned,  and  it  was  upon  this  rock  of  divided</span><span>  descent  that  poor  Wilganan's  love  idyll</span><span>  crashed.</span></p> <p><span>  Wilganan  was  born  at  Wilogup  some  time</span><span>  after  tier  supplanters  had  won  Abe  battle</span><span>  of  Waterloo.  Paternal  descent  obtained</span><span>  in  her  family  group,  and-  Wilganan  was</span><span>  bom  n  Manitchmat;  following  her  father's</span><span>  line,  her  mother  being  Wordungmat.  Her</span><span>  name  was  bestowed  from  the  wilgi  or  wilox</span><span>  (red  ochre)  at  Wilogup,  which  tradition</span><span>  said  was  once  the  blood  of  the  Walja</span><span>  (eaglehawk),  .whom  his  nephew  Wordung</span><span>  (crow)  had  speared  for  biding  the  good</span><span>  water.  In  Xyitting  (cold)  times,  Wilganan</span><span>  was  told,  Walja  had  good  fresu  water  to</span><span>  drink,  but  would  not  tell  Wordung  where'</span><span>  the  good,  clean  water  was  hidden,  so  Wor</span><span>  dung  had  to  drink  bad  water  always,  which</span><span>  made  him  thin,  malodorous,  and  rod-eyed,</span><span>  while  his  uncle  Walja  was  sled:,  fat,  and</span><span>  clear-eyed.  I</span></p> <p><span>  On  day  Wordung  said,  \"I  will  watch  j</span><span>  Kong-gan  (raotherbj  brother  uncle)  and</span><span>  see  where  he  gets  his  good  water.\"  So  he</span><span>  sat  in  a  high  jerrail  (jarrah)  at  Hannu</span><span>  burduu,  and  presently  Walja  came  to  his</span><span>  kal  (fire)  carrying  a  kangaroo,  which  he</span><span>  had  ran  down  ana  killed.  Walja  made  a</span><span>  fire  to  cook  his  meat,  and  when  he  had'</span><span>  eaten  he  stood  up  and  looked  all  round</span><span>  him,  but  he  could  not  see  Wordung  high</span><span>  up  in  tbe  jerrail,  Walja  went  over  to  some</span><span>  boy-a  (rocks),  and  lifting  up  oue  of  them</span><span>  he  stopped  and  drank  of  the  hidden  water,</span><span>  and  then  carefully  covering  it  over  he  re</span><span>  turned  to  his,  kal  and  went  to  sleep.  Wor</span></p> <p><span>  dung  said.  \"What  a  greedy  Kong-gan  to  |</span><span>  keep  all  that  good  water  for  himself,\"  a</span></p> <p><span>  o  r  and</span><span>  while  Walja  slept  he  went  to  the  boy-a,  i</span><span>  and  lifting  up  the  stone  he  drank  and  drank  j</span><span>  the  good  water  until  he  was  full.  Then  he  j</span><span>  scratched  himself  and  threw  lice  into  the</span></p> <p><span>  water  until  it  was  covered  over  with  them  j</span><span>  and  spoiled,  gnd  he  put  the  stone  on  top;</span><span>  again  and  returned  to  the  jerrail..</span></p> <p><span>  By  and  by  Walja  went  over  for  another</span><span>  drink,  and  lifted  the  stone,  hut  the  lice</span><span>  had  already  spoiled  the  water,  and  were</span><span>  creeping,  creeping,  creeping  all  over  it.</span><span>  Walja  Mid,  \"My.moy-er  (outer's  son)  has</span><span>  fonnd  out  my  water,  and  has  spoiled  it,\";</span><span>  and  he  looked  about  for  Wordung.  r  Woi>  i</span><span>  dung,  who  was  watching  from  the  jerrail,j</span><span>  threw  his  spear  at  Walia,  and  Walja  ran  to  j</span><span>  Wilogup,  and  dropped  blood  there,  and</span><span>  the  blood  turned  into  wilok  or  wilgi,  and</span><span>  the  place  was  called  Wilogup.  Walja  tried</span><span>  to  rest,  but  Wordung  .would  not  let  hint</span><span>  rest,  and  Walja  ran  and  ran  until  he</span><span>  reached  Been-gurda,  where  he  died.</span></p> <p><span>  Wiigansn's  father  gave  her  the  wilgi</span><span>  for  her  personal  totem,  and  6he  could  make</span><span>  gifts  of  ochre  at  all  times.  Her  father's</span><span>  group  totem  was  the  ngau  (mallee  hen).  '</span></p> <p><span>  One  of  the  first  traditions  learned  and</span><span>  treasured  by  Wilganan  was  the  Walja</span><span>  legend  connected  with  her  name  aud  birth</span><span>  place,  but  the  myths  and  folk  lore  of  her</span><span>  people  held  her  attention  at  all  times.  At</span><span>  Woorungup  she  heard  about  the  woggal</span><span>  (magic  carpet  snake),  who  spat  out  the</span><span>  water  that  made  the  spring  and  running</span><span>  brook  there.  In  the  winter  plenty  of  fish</span><span>  could  be  caught  at  the  mouth  of  the  spring,</span><span>  and  though  the  salt  water  covered,  it,</span><span>  Wilganan  could  stoop  down  aud  hold  her</span></p> <p><span>  mouth  close  to  the  dwal-ya  and  drink  the</span><span>  gdod  water  which  the  snake  spat  out.</span><span>  Place  legends  gave  way  to  myths  of  her</span><span>  people's  origin,  and  she  was  told  liow</span><span>  Wau-oo,  the  mopoke,  assisted  by  his  rela</span><span>  tion,  Beenar,  the  white  owl,  made  &U  the</span><span>  Bibbulmun,  and  divided  them,  saying,</span><span>  \"Manitchmat  must  marry  Wordungmat</span><span>  only\";  and  her  mother  told  her  the  Story  of</span><span>  Kalil,  the  sergeant  ant,  who  had  a  kamba,</span><span>  (fiat  wooden  stick,  used  for.  getting  seed</span><span>  dampers,  roots,  aud  other  cooked  foods  out</span><span>  of  flie  ashes)\u2014the  forerunner  of  tlie  fire!</span></p> <p><span>  shovel\u2014which  he  carried  under  Lis  kanga-:</span><span>  roo  skin  cloak,,  and  he  called,  to  the  chil</span><span>  dren,  \"Come  closer,  come  closer,  I  can't</span><span>  hear  you.\"  And  when  the  children  came</span><span>  clpse  to  him,  Kalil  killed  tbeni  with  his</span><span>  kamba;  but  Jerragurt,  tlie  little  lizard,</span><span>  who  -  was  -  Wilganan's  ancestor,  always</span><span>  gathered  up  the  pieces  and  .made  the</span><span>  children  all  right-again  w  ith  his  tongue.</span></p> <p><span>  .  When  a  rainbow  appeared,  Wilganan</span><span>  tried  to  see  the  spirits  which  ran  and</span><span>  danced  through  it,  aud  at  night  she</span><span>  watched  the  moon's  dog-stars  coming  up</span></p> <p><span>  to  hunt  for  him.</span></p> <p><span>  Tradition,  legend,  and  myth  were  told</span><span>  in  the  firelight  when  the  family  groups</span><span>  had  eaten  and  drunk,  and  the  children</span><span>  were  gathered  together  round  their  elders.</span><span>  All  Bibbulmun  cliildrcu  must  learn  the</span><span>  ancestral  laws  of  food  aud  drink,  of  bird</span><span>  and  beast,  and  fish,  of  springs  and  pools,</span><span>  forbidden  rocks,  and  trees  and  hills,  but.</span><span>  above  all,  of  the  laws  of  relationship  ana</span><span>  marriage,  so  that  Wilganan  knew  from</span><span>  her  earliest  years  that  death  was  the</span><span>  penalty  for  wrong  marriages,  and  that  all</span></p> <p><span>  young  Manitchmat  were  her  blood  rela</span><span>  tions  only,  she^ejng  a  MwitAfrt.  8he</span><span>  was  betrothed  minfancy  to  Jtmborit,  a</span><span>  Wordungmat,  ber  mother's  brother's  son,</span><span>  and  in  aue  time  she  would  hare  been</span><span>  handed  over  to  her  daajeluk  who  kept</span><span>  her  family  in  meat  throughout  all  the</span><span>  years  of  betrothal.  ~</span></p> <p><span>  Wilganan  spent  a  free  and  happy  child</span><span>  hood  amongst  the  hQls  and  streams  and</span><span>  inlets  of  her  home,  and  grew  to  the  beauty</span><span>  desired  of  .  her  people,  straight,  strong</span><span>  limbed,  and  full-bosomed.  North  and  south</span><span>  the  family  groups  wandered  to  attend  the</span><span>  Beeda-wa  (initiation  into  manhood)  cere</span><span>  monies,  which  were  held  when  special</span><span>  supplies  of  district  totem  foods\u2014salmon,</span><span>  swan,  mallee  hen,  &c.\u2014were  available.</span><span>  When  Wilganan's  group  went  north  for</span><span>  Beeda-wa  they  always  formed  their,  camps</span><span>  to  the  southward,  and  kept  amongst  their</span><span>  own  blood  relations.  The  young  people</span><span>  of  both  sexes  were  also  kept  apart  because</span><span>  of  the  difference  in  descent;  but  it  was</span><span>  at  one  of  these  northern  gatherings  that</span><span>  Wilganan,  then  in  her  very  early  teems,  fell</span><span>  in  love  with  Nelungit,  a  northern  Manitcb</span><span>  mat,  and  the  son  or  a  Manitchmat  mother</span><span>  She  knew  that  by  the  laws  of  her  people</span><span>  Nelungit  belonged  to  her  \"brother  stock,\"</span></p> <p><span>  but  her  yqui^j  love,  coming,  instant  and</span></p> <p><span>  strong,  made  little  account  of  law  6r  pun</span></p> <p><span>  ishment,  and  the  little  Juliet's  fate  was</span><span>  waled.  Nelungit,  like  all  communist  males</span><span>  \u2014black,  yellow,  or  white\u2014was  a  poor-min</span><span>  ted  creature.  On  the  instant  that  Wil</span></p> <p><span>  ganan's  eyes  caught  his  he  knew  she  loved</span><span>  him,  but  from  first  to  last  he  gave  no</span><span>  token  of  other  knowledge  or  reciproca</span><span>  tion.  He  danced  more  vainly,  and  posed</span><span>  more  frequently  in  all  the  birds'  down</span><span>  and  ochred  panoply  of  the  full-fledged</span><span>  young  Bibbuunun,  put  though  time  and</span><span>  again  he  met  the  glance  of  the  young</span><span>  loving  eyes  fixed  upon  him,  he  never  made</span><span>  toe  slightest  response.  Gifts  of  special</span><span>  foods,  grubs,  the  best  wads  of  ochre,  belts</span><span>  of  hair  made  from  Wilganan's  long  red</span><span>  black  tresses,  and  many  other  tokens  of</span><span>  her  love  came  to  him  by  devious  ways,  and</span><span>  he  took  them  all,  but  no  present  reached</span><span>  Wilganan  in  return,  and  no  sign  came  to</span><span>  her  that  Nelungit  desired  her  or  wished  toi</span><span>  elope  with  her.</span></p> <p><span>  Wilganan's  love  grew  in  the  months  that</span><span>  followed,  and  at  every  ceremony  where</span><span>  the  two  groups  met,  her  glance  sought  Ne</span><span>  lungit's  for  encouragement  or  favour,  but</span></p> <p><span>  found  none.</span></p> <p><span>  Her  giri  friends  jewed  and  teased  her.</span><span>  \"Manitchmat  can't  marry  Manitchmat;</span><span>  that  isn't  loving;  it  is  adulterous.\"  f*But</span><span>  if  he  came  to  my  home  he  would  be  Wor</span><span>  dungmat,  for  his  father  is  Wordung</span><span>  mat,  and  if  he  takes  me  to  his  k&lleep,</span><span>  I  will  be  Wordungmat,  for  my  mother  h</span><span>  Wordungmat,\"  Wilganan  would  argue.</span><span>  \"Nelungit  has  his  own  home.  He  doesn't</span><span>  want  an  immoral  woman.\"  But  toe</span><span>  strength  of  Wilganan's  love  overrode  jeer</span></p> <p><span>  and  sneer.</span></p> <p><span>  Wilganan  bad  heard  many  traditions  of</span><span>  young  women  of  ghost  times  breaking  away</span><span>  tram  their  home,  and  adventuring  into  un</span></p> <p><span>  known  country  beyond  their  territory,</span><span>  never  to  be  seen  again  by  their  home  folk.</span><span>  Runaway  couples,  too,  had  fled  into  toe</span><span>  mysterious  country  of  the  circumcised</span></p> <p><span>  people,  whence  they  never  returned.  Pom  |</span><span>  Wilganan  was  willing  to  be  taken  anywhere</span><span>  by  Nelungit,  and  waited  and  hoped  that</span><span>  some  day  he  would  give  her  the  needful</span><span>  sign  to  elope  with  him;  but  in  those  com</span><span>  munal  hordes  there  was  no  individuality,</span><span>  no  manhood,  no  courage  amongst  the</span><span>  males.  They  beat  their  women  instead  of</span><span>  each  other;  yet,  quaintly  enough,  any</span><span>  \"agitator\"  who  boasted  or  tried  to  assert</span><span>  himself,  or  who  showed  individual  traite:</span><span>  of  character  superior  to  his  kind,  was  killed</span><span>  openly  by  ten  or  twelve  pouncing  suddenly</span><span>  upon  nim\u2014a  communist  takes  no  chances\u2014</span><span>  or  secretly  by  magic.  Nelungit  .followed</span><span>  the  cowardly  instincts  of  his  kind,  and</span><span>  made  no  tryst  with  Wilganan.</span></p> <p><span>  There  came  another  Beeda-wa  which  the</span><span>  groups  of  both  young  people  were  to  attend,</span><span>  and  Wilganan  made  up  her  mind  to  follow</span><span>  Nelungit  to  liis  northern  home,  hoping</span></p> <p><span>  that  when  she  had  taken  the  irrevocable</span><span>  step  he  would  take  her  somewhere,  and  all:</span><span>  would  be  welL  On  the  last  night  of  the</span><span>  Beeda-wa  she  sang  and  dancea  with  the</span><span>  girls  and  women,  and  moved  her  graceful</span><span>  young  body  and  limbB  to  the  music  of  dub</span><span>  and  boomerang,  and  toe  strains  of  totem,</span><span>  and  Beeda-wa  songs.  Music  and  song  and</span><span>  dance  went  on  far  into  toe  night,  to  the;</span><span>  sound  of  the  sea  booming  on  the  rocks</span><span>  along  the  beach,  and  early  next  morning</span><span>  toe  groups  separated  for.  their  respective</span></p> <p><span>  homes.</span></p> <p><span>  Nelungit  found  the  young  bachelors  going</span><span>  northward,  the  party  hunting  in  leisurely</span><span>  fatoion  as  they  strolled  along.  Several</span><span>  young  men  of  Wilganan's  own  group  were</span><span>  going  with  the  party  on  a  visit  to  Koom</span><span>  bernup  and  Beenjarup  (Bunbury  and  Pin</span><span>  jarra).</span></p> <p><span>  Wilganan  went  southward  with  her</span><span>  people  for  a  time,  and  then,  making  a  slight</span><span>  detour,  she  turned  and  retraced  her  steps</span><span>  northwards.  She  walked  along  the  beach</span><span>  wherever  possible  in  order  to  hide  her</span><span>  tracks.  She  had  brought  some  food  with</span><span>  her,  perhaps  in  order  that  she  might  have</span><span>  a  meal  ready  for  her  lover  when  they  met.</span></p> <p><span>  On  the  fourth  day  toe  was  close  behind  the,</span><span>  party,  and  in  her  eagnerness  to  let  her</span><span>  beloved  gain  sight  of  her  She  ventured  into</span><span>  the  open.  Someone  saw  her.  hut  Nelungit</span><span>  did  hot  turn  his  head,  though  toe  knew  he</span><span>  had  been  told  of  her  nearness.  /</span></p> <p><span>  The  young  men  moved  oh  mid  toe  walked</span><span>  quietly  behind,  now  altogether  in  the  open.</span><span>  Her  cloak  hanging  from  \u25a0her  toouldera  and</span><span>  covering  the  lithe  young  body._  On  and  oh</span><span>  they  went,  Nelungit  looking  steadily  north</span></p> <p><span>  ward.  '</span></p> <p><span>  Did  his  comrades  venture  to  jeer  at  him,</span></p> <p><span>  or  did  a  light  laugh  ring  out?

Whatever  .occurred</span><span>  to  move  him  to  action,  Nelungit  turned</span><span>  back  alone  while  toe  others  walked  on</span><span>  without  looking  hack.</span></p> <p><span>  Wilganan  saw  him  turn,  and  then,  with</span><span>  downcast  eyes,  awaited  his  coming  in</span><span>  trembling  and  happy  expectancy.  Hence</span><span>  forth  and  for  ever  toe  would'meekly  follow</span><span>  him  over  hill  and  dale  to.  the.  home  he</span><span>  would  choose  for  her,  and  by  and  by,</span></p> <p><span>  little</span></p> <p><span>  perhaps,  her  Koug-gan  would  let  a</span></p> <p><span>  spirit  baby\u2014who  must  alwajra^go  first  to</span></p> <p><span>  Kong^gan\u2014come  \u2022  to  her.  .  ^Vhat  happy</span></p> <p><span>  thoughts  passed  through  the  primitive</span><span>  young  creature's  mind  as  she  waited  the</span><span>  'coming  of  ber  lover?

Perhaps</span><span>  she  felt  it  was  better  to  die  at  his  hands</span></p> <p><span>  than  lire  without  him.  Nelungit  jerked</span><span>  his  spear  i-Ou^fyirtsn-th^  bPbr  writhing</span><span>  creature,  ebd  turned  at  once  to  join  his</span><span>  companions;  but  though  Nelungit  had</span><span>  never  seen  the  white  men,  white  settle</span><span>  ment  had  begun  in  the  south-west,  and  the</span><span>  older  men  amongst  the  group  had  already</span><span>  learned  something  of  the  white  man's  laws,</span><span>  even  in  those  early  thirties.  Thev  gave</span><span>  him  a  firesticb,  and  auggeated  that  he</span><span>  should  burn  the  body  and  cover  it  over</span><span>  with  brushwood,  so  that  the  white  man</span><span>  should  not  come  upon  it.  The  mean</span><span>  spirited  creature  took  the  firestick,  and</span><span>  set  fire  to  the  tittle  creature  even  before</span><span>  life  had  departed  from  her.  When  his</span><span>  work  was  completed,  Nelungit  rejoined  the</span></p> <p><span>  group.</span></p> <p><span>  Thp  white  settlers,  however,  found  the</span><span>  charred  remains.  Inquiry  was  made,  and  as</span><span>  amongst  these  communal  hordes  there  is</span><span>  no  such  thing  as  honour  or  fealty,  his  com</span><span>  panions  told  what  they  saw.  All  the  facts</span><span>  were  brought  to  light,  and  Nelungit  was</span><span>  tried,  convicted,  and  duly  hanged  for  the</span></p> <p><span>  murder.</span></p> "}
