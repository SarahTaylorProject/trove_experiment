The  Com-</span><span>  men\u00e7ai  Bank,  as  is  well  known,  has  a</span><span>  branch  establishment  in  South-street,  but</span><span>  the  extension  of  that  suburb  has  been  so</span><span>  I  rapid,  and  the  population  in  its  most  out-</span></p> <p><span>  lying  parts  has  increased  to  such  an  ex-</span><span>  tent,  that  Smith-street  is  regarded  as</span><span>  inconvenient  by  those,  who  .reside  in  the</span><span>  outskirts,  and  are  obliged  to  have  recourse</span><span>  to  that  busy  thoroughfare  for  the  trans-</span></p> <p><span>  action  of  banking  business.  Regarding  :</span><span>  the  matter  in  that  light,  some  of  the  cus-</span><span>  tomers  of  the  Commercial  Bank  complain-</span><span>  ed  of  the  inconvenience  they  were  put  to,</span></p> <p><span>  and  \u00bfhe  bank  authorities,  recognising  the</span><span>  force  of  these  complaints,  decided  to</span><span>  establish  a  sub-agency  in  some  other  por-</span><span>  tion  of  the  city.  With  this  object  in  view,</span><span>  the  bank  entered  into  an  agreement  with</span><span>  Mrs.  Ravenscroft  for  the  lease  of  a  por</span><span>  \u00a1  tion  of  her  house  in  Hoddle-street.  Here</span></p> <p><span>  it  was  that  about  three  weeks  ago  the</span><span>  Commercial  Bank  opened  a  sub-agency,</span><span>  placing  Mr.  James  N.  -Hill  incharge  of  it.</span><span>  In  a  building  affording  little  security  for</span><span>  a  hanking  institution  it  was  not  to  be  :</span><span>  supposed  that  any  money  would  be  left  lu</span><span>  the  place  overnight.  It,  therefore,  form-</span><span>  ed  a  part  of  Mr.  Hill's  duties  to  bring  all</span><span>  the  money  every  afternoon  to  the  branch</span><span>  bank  in  Smith-street,  and  to  call  again  for</span></p> <p><span>  it  every  morning.  The  money  was  hand</span><span>  !  ed  over  to  him  between  nine  and  ten</span></p> <p><span>  o'clock  every  morning,  and  it  was  his  in-</span><span>  variable  custom  to  walk  to  the  sub.agency</span><span>  in  Hoddle-street,  carrying  the  money  in  a</span><span>  black  leather  bag.  The  excitement  creat-</span><span>  ed  by  the  sticking  up  of  the  bank  in</span><span>  Simpson's-road  had  died  away,  and  no</span><span>  one  ever  imagined  thai  the  unpretentious</span><span>  sub-agency  in  Hoddle-street  would  so</span><span>  soon  after  its  establishment  be  the  scene</span><span>  of  such  a  tragedy  as  was  enacted  there  on</span><span>  Tuesdav  morning'.</span></p> <p><span>  The  facts,  simply  told,  are  as  follows  :</span><span>  Mr.  Hill  called  at  the  bank  in  Smith-street</span><span>  at  the  usual  hour  in  the  morning,  and</span><span>  took  away  with  him  in  a  black  leather</span><span>  bag,  money  amounting  in  round  numbers</span><span>  to  about  \u00a3300  in  coin  and  notes  of  the</span><span>  bank.  He  reached  the  sub-agency  in</span><span>  Hoddie-street  and  found  everything  as</span><span>  usual.  The  door  was  opened  at  10  a.m.,</span><span>  and  Mr.  Hill,  after  putting  things  in  order,</span></p> <p><span>  took  his  seat  at  the  desk,  which  was</span><span>  placed  against  and  at  right  angles  with</span><span>  the  portion  of  the  counter  nearest  the</span><span>  frout  window.  J8b  customers  coming  in,</span><span>  Mr.  Hill  began  to  read.  Shortly  after-</span><span>  wards,  and  between  half-past  ten  and  a</span><span>  quarter  to  eleven  o'clock,  as  nearly  as  can</span><span>  be  ascertained,  Mr.  Hill,  whose  face  was</span><span>  sideways  to  the  door,  thought  he  per-</span><span>  ceived  the  shadow  of  some  one  entering</span><span>  the  room.  He  turned  instantly  round,</span><span>  and  was  confronted  by  a  man  covering</span><span>  him  with  a  revolver,  who  exclaimed  in  a</span><span>  loud  tone,  \"  Here  young  mau,  hold  up.\"</span><span>  With  a  coolness  and  courage  which  can-</span><span>  not  be  too  highly  eulogised,  Mr.  Hill</span><span>  jumped  off  his  desk  and  made  a  grasp  at</span><span>  his  own  revolver,  which  was  lying  some</span><span>  distance  from  the  desk.  The  revolver</span><span>  was  loaded  in  its  six  chambers,  but  un-</span><span>  fortunately,  when  Mr.  Hill  pulled  the</span><span>  trigger  his  revolver  missed  fire.  By,</span></p> <p><span>  this  time  the  man  whom  Mr.  Hill  first</span><span>  perceived,  crouched  down  underneath  the</span><span>  counter.  Mr.  Hill  pulled  the  trigger  a</span><span>  second  time,  and  the  revolver  went  off,</span><span>  but  the  shot  took  no  effect.  Seeing  that</span><span>  he  had  four  men  to  deal  with  instead  of</span><span>  one,  Mr.  Hill  at  once  realised  the  des-</span><span>  perate  nature  of  his  position,  and  resolved</span><span>  to  act  accordingly.  He  closed  with  the</span><span>  desperadoes,  and  dealt  one  of  them  a  very</span><span>  severe  blow  iu  the  face,  marking  him  in</span><span>  such  a  way  that  the  fellow  will  have  great</span></p> <p><span>  difficulty  in  concealing  his  identity.  The  j</span><span>  quarters  were  so  close  that  at  one  period</span><span>  of  the  scuffle  which  ensued  the  muzzle  of</span><span>  Mr.  Hill's  revolver  was  pressing  against</span></p> <p><span>  the  body  of  one  of  his  assailants.  H&lt;</span><span>  nulled  the  trigger,  but  again  the  pisto!</span><span>  missed  fire.  One  of  the  men,  catching</span><span>  Mr.  Hill  from  behind,  nearly  choked  him</span><span>  and  it  was  by  an  almost  superhuman</span><span>  effort  that  he  released  himself  from  hit</span><span>  grasp.  While  the  struggle  was  going  on</span><span>  Mr.  Hill  continued  calling  out  for  help,</span><span>  trusting  that  the  people  in  the  street</span><span>  would  come  to  his  assistance.  Seeing  the</span><span>  determined  nature  of  the  resistance  offer-</span><span>  ed  hy  Mr.  Hill,  two  of  the  men  opened</span><span>  the  door  and  made  off,  and  by  this</span><span>  time  Mrs.  Ravenscroft,  attracted  by  the</span><span>  noise  and  pistol  shot  in  the  bank  room,</span><span>  ran  ont  into  the  street  aud  got  as  far  as  the</span><span>  bank  door  when  she  dropped  down  shot</span><span>  through  the  head.  It  appears  that  when  one</span><span>  of  Mr.  Hill's  assailants  was  in  the  act</span><span>  of  passing  through  the  door,  Mr.  Hill</span><span>  fired  after  him,  and  the  bullet,  instead</span><span>  of  hitting  its  intended  victim,  entered</span><span>  the  side  of  Mrs.  Ravenscroft's  head,  pass</span><span>  out  through  the  left  temple.  She  had</span><span>  evidently  got  to  the  bank  door  at  the  same</span><span>  moment  the  shot  was  fired.  Death  ensued</span><span>  abont  two  minutes  afterwards,  and  the</span><span>  \u00cdoor  woman's  body  was  removed  to  her</span></p> <p><span>  edroem.</span></p> <p><span>  Bearing  the  shots  and  seeing  Mrs.</span><span>  Ravenscroft  fall,  a  crowd  soon  collected</span><span>  in  front  of  the  bank.  Mr.  Hill  was  un-</span><span>  conscious  of  Mrs.  Ravenscroft's  death  un-</span><span>  til  he  saw  her  body  lying  on  the  footpath.</span><span>  As  soon  as  he  saw  the  people  at  the  door,</span><span>  be  handed  one  of  the  men  who  had  stuck</span><span>  up  the  bank  over  to  them,  thinking  that</span><span>  he  would  foe  well  looked  after,  but  strange</span><span>  to  say  he  was  allowed  to  escape.  This</span><span>  was  the  man  with  whom  Mr.  Hill  had</span><span>  such  a  severe  struggle  on  the  floor,  and</span><span>  who  had  nearly  throttled  him.  When  the</span><span>  encounter  was  over  its  severity  was  ap-</span><span>  parent,  and  Mr.  Hill's  pluck  in  straggl-</span><span>  ing  so  successfully  against  such  great</span><span>  odds  cannot  be  too  highly  commended.</span><span>  He  saved  the  property  of  his  employers</span></p> <p><span>  most  manfully,  and  it  is  only  to  be  re-  j</span></p> <p><span>  gretted  that  the  life  of  an  innocent  wo*</span><span>  man  was  sacrified  by  an  accident.</span></p> <p><span>  I  One  of  the  ruffians  waa  secured.  He</span><span>  \u00a1  was  seen  running  away,  and  was  folio  wt  d</span></p> <p><span>  by  a  matt  on  horseback  and  brought  back</span><span>  !  to  the  bank,  where  he  was  given  in  charge</span></p> <p><span>  to  Constable  Gleeson.  He  gave  his  name</span><span>  as  James  Williams,  but  his  real  name  is</span><span>  Hopkins,  the  son  of  a  cabman,  who  died</span><span>  suddenly  a  short  time  since.  He  is  a</span><span>  diminutive  looking  fellow  of  the  larrikin</span><span>  tpye.  He  is  21  years  of  age,  but  looks</span><span>  much  younger.  He  was  conveyed  to  the</span><span>  Collingwood  lockup,  where  he  remained</span><span>  very  reticent  as  regards  his  associates  in</span><span>  the  sticking  up  of  the  bank.  Four  or  five</span><span>  men  were  subsequently  arrested  on  suspi-</span><span>  cion.  Hopkins's  mother  recognised  them</span><span>  as  sume  of  her  son's  companions  ;  but  Mr.</span><span>  HUI  failed  to  identify  them  as  being  any</span></p> <p><span>  of  his  assailants.</span></p> <p><span>  Mr.  HUI  at  first  thought  he  had  only</span><span>  one  man  to  deal  with,  anet  the  fact  of  jbis</span><span>  :  being  a  young  man  of  great  physical</span></p> <p><span>  strength,  enabled  him  to  maintain  the</span><span>  struggle  so  successfully,  until  fear  of  the</span><span>  arrival  of  assistance  caused  tho  ruffians</span><span>  to  clear  off  the  premises  as  best  they</span><span>  could.  Tho  robbery  must  have  been,</span><span>  maturely  planned,  but  in  carrying  it  oat</span><span>  the  would-be  robbers  displayed  the  great</span><span>  I  est  indecision  and  cowardice.  The</span></p> <p><span>  revolver  which  one  of  their  number</span><span>  i  presented  at  Mr.  Hill  was  a  six-barrelled,,</span></p> <p><span>  old  fashioned  one,  commonly  known  as  a</span><span>  I  \"  pepper  box.\"  They  do  not  appear  to</span><span>  |  have  fired  a  shot.  In  the  scufiue  which</span></p> <p><span>  took  place  between  the  bank  manager  and</span><span>  i  themselves  two  of  their  number  lost  their</span></p> <p><span>  I  hats,  and  they  also  left  behind  them  the</span><span>  revolver,  a  bar  of  iron,  and  a  tomahawk.</span><span>  The  men  are  all  young,  and  belong  to  the</span><span>  larrikin  class.  There  is  no  criminal</span><span>  record  against  the  one  in  custody,  hut  he</span><span>  has  been  known  to  the  police  as  a  rowdily</span></p> <p><span>  inclined  larrikin.</span></p> <p><span>  The  police  authorities  were  on  WeuTfcsa</span><span>  day  last  engaged  trying  to  discover</span></p> <p><span>  traces  of  the  scoundrels  who  assisted  the</span><span>  prisoner  Hopkins  in  the  bank  robbery  at</span><span>  Collingwood,  but  up  to  a  late  hour  that</span><span>  evening  had  obtained  no  reliable  clue.!</span><span>  One  remarkable  feature  in  the  case,  which</span><span>  shows  the  cool  impudence  with  which  the</span><span>  would-be  robbers  were  endowed,  was</span><span>  reported  to  the  police  by  the  resident</span><span>  surgeon  of  the  Melbourne  Hospital.  Be-</span></p> <p><span>  tween  eleven  and  twelve  o'clock  on.  -</span><span>  Tuesday  morning  a  man  giving  hiB  name</span><span>  as  Pepper  presented  himself  at  the</span><span>  hospital  with  a  gunshot  wound  in  the</span><span>  arm,  and-  wished  to  have  the  bullet</span><span>  extracted.  In  conversation  with  a  surgeon</span><span>  he  informed  him  that  a  companion  of  his</span><span>  had  accidentally  shot  him.  The  doctor,,</span><span>  not  having  heard  of  the  occurrence  in</span><span>  Collingwood,  extracted  the  ballet  and.</span><span>  allowed  Pepper  to  depart.  When  the</span><span>  news  of  the  attempted  robbery  reached,</span><span>  his  ears,  the  doctor  at  once  thought  that</span><span>  the  man  he  had  treated  might  be  one  of</span><span>  those  who  were  implicated,  and  forwarded,</span><span>  the  bullet  to  the  police,  at  the  same  time*</span><span>  informing  them  of  the  fact.  The  bullet</span><span>  given  to  the  police  was  afterwards  dis-</span><span>  covered  to  correspond  exactly  with  those</span><span>  fired  by  Mr.  Hill.  The  description  of</span><span>  Pepper  given  to  the  police  by  the  surgeon,</span><span>  is  similar  to  that  reported  hy  the  bank</span><span>  manager,  and  it  is  surmised  that  he  ia.</span><span>  identical  with  one  of  the  desperadoes.</span></p> <p><span>  Leader.</span></p> "}
