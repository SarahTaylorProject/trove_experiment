The</span><span>  business  of  the  session  will,  indeed,</span><span>  commence  with  this  week,  when  the  first  of</span><span>  the  financial  proposals  of  the  Government</span><span>  with  regard  to  the  issue  of</span><span>  Exchequer  Bills  will  be  debated.  Two</span><span>  questions  have,  however,  been  pushed</span><span>  through  all  their  stages.  The  one  is</span><span>  a  bill  for  the  construction  of  the  Lancefield</span></p> <p><span>  railway,  the  ostensible  object  of</span><span>  which  is  to  relieve  the  pressure  upon  the</span><span>  labour  market,  but  which  at  the  same</span><span>  time  rewards  certain  political  supporters</span><span>  of  the  Ministry,  and  the  other  is  for  the</span><span>  payment  of  members.  This  measure</span><span>  reenacts  payment  at  the  rate  of  \u00a3300  per</span><span>  annum,  and  provides  for  its  continuance</span><span>  until  the  end  of  the  first  session  of  the</span><span>  next  Parliament  succeeding  to  this.  Mr.</span></p> <p><span>  Terry  moved  the  second  reading  on</span><span>  Thursday,  September  9,  and  a  desultory</span><span>  discussion  ensued,  with  the  result  that</span><span>  the  second  reading  was  carried  on  a</span><span>  division  by  42  voles  to  20,  and  the</span><span>  bill  was  passed  rapidly  through  all  its</span><span>  stages,  and  was  ordered  to  be  sent  to  the</span><span>  Legislative  Council.  The  opponents  of</span><span>  the  principle  contented  themselves  with</span><span>  suggesting  amendments,  In  particular,</span><span>  they  contended  that  the  amount  of  re-</span><span>  ?????Dilute  t  w  \"ht  to  be  reduced  just  as</span><span>  the  salaries  zzzzzzJ-IC  er  public  servants  were</span><span>  being  ?????r  c  \"  n,  and  also  that  the  bill</span><span>  should  be  divided  into  two  parts,  one  for</span><span>  the  payment  of  the  Assembly  and  the</span><span>  other  for  the  Council.  This,  it  was</span><span>  ar0ued,  would  gno  the  C'uuncd  freedom</span><span>  of  etion,  and  would  not  force  lion  mern</span><span>  bcrs  in  anothoi  placo  eithor  to  pay  thom</span><span>  solve  or  reject  the  measure,  and  thus</span><span>  bring  the  two  Houses  into  collision.  Mr.</span><span>  Murray  Smith's  proposal  to  divide  the</span><span>  measure  was  negatived  by  40  votes  to  21,</span><span>  and  in  amendment  by  Mr.  Carter  to  re-</span><span>  sinco  the  amount  to  \u00a3200  was  rejected  on</span></p> <p><span>  the  voices.</span></p> <p><span>  Some  animated  proceedings  have  oc-</span><span>  curred  in  connexion  with  the  election  of</span><span>  the  Chairman  of  Committees  of  the</span></p> <p><span>  Assembly.  There  were  three  candidates</span><span>  from  the  Ministerial  side--  Mr.  Mirams,</span><span>  the  secietary  of  the  Iteform  League  ,</span><span>  Mr.  Mason  ;  and  Mr.  Gaunson,  the</span><span>  nrtonous  member  for  Am  it,  whoso</span><span>  vituperative  abilities  ha  o  been  eveicisoJ</span><span>  alternately  at  the  expense  or  tho  ono</span></p> <p><span>  Eitle  and  the  other  Mini  tersfivomcd</span><span>  Mr.i  Gaunson,  whom  they  wished  to</span><span>  Eilcnce,  but  it  was  not  thought  seen  ly  to</span><span>  linke  an  open  choice  of  the  rp  ondam  ad</span><span>  vcisary  as  a0amst  so  faithful  a  seivicoi</span></p> <p><span>  is  Mi  Mu  HUB  A  caucus  v  as  theiefore</span><span>  held,  and  i  \"  v  ote  m  the  hat  vva3tiken,</span><span>  with  the  result--  Gaunson,  28  votes,</span><span>  Mirams,  10,  and  Mason,  3  ,  and  the</span><span>  Ministerial  members  generally  agreed  to</span><span>  he  bound  by  this  decision  In  the  IIouso</span><span>  Mi  Olives  uid  Mr  Pincham  stood</span><span>  si  jnsors  foi  the  member  for  Ararat,  Mr</span><span>  1  mcliam  claimin0  support  foi  his  pioUgc</span><span>  <  n  tho  ground  that  giv  mg  him  the  ellan</span><span>  would  \"enable  linn  to  restrain  himself</span><span>  when  it  is  dcsirablo  that  lio  should  ro</span><span>  stram  himself,  and  so  make  him  a  sac</span><span>  cehsful  politician  \"  Mr  Longmore,  e\\</span><span>  Mmistei  of  Landa,  reminded  tho</span><span>  House  that  Mr.  Gaunson's  abuse  of</span><span>  the  late  Berry  Government  was  so</span><span>  continued  and  so  offensive  that  a</span><span>  emeus  was  called  by  Ministers  for  the</span><span>  lurposeof  eithor  silencing  lum  or  ov.pel</span></p> <p><span>  ling  lum  ,  and,  now,  said  Mr  Longmore,</span></p> <p><span>  this  self  samo  nicmbei  was  to  bo  row  aided</span><span>  v,  \u00edtli  a  place  which  should  only  be  given</span><span>  to  a  man  of  weight  and  principle  And</span><span>  Mr  M  ison  made  mention  of  Mr  Berry  s</span><span>  emphatic  declaration  that  Mr.  Gaunson</span></p> <p><span>  \"was  a  bully,  and  the  only  bully  in  the</span><span>  House  ;  \"  while  Mr  Murray  Smith</span><span>  pointed  out  that  the  xesult  of  the  caucus</span><span>  y-tem  was  that  a  man  who  oildonly</span><span>  obtun  28  votes,  and  w'io  was  consid\u00b0red</span><span>  objettionablo  by  tho  great  body  of  tlio</span><span>  House,  was  to  bo  foisted  upon  it  The</span><span>  voting  on  the  division  was-For  Mi</span><span>  0  tunsoii,  43  ,  a0ainst,  \u00bf2</span></p> <p><span>  The  Chief  Sociotviy,  Mr  Beny,</span><span>  brought  under  the  notico  of  tho  Hoiibo</span><span>  that  as  Mr  Wrixon,  the  member  foi</span><span>  I'oitland,  has  changed  his  seat,  and  sits</span><span>  in  tho  Opposition  coinei,  the  Govern</span><span>  ment  liad  not  a  majority  on  the  Elections</span><span>  mid  Qualifications  Committee  Mr</span><span>  Vi  ison  at  once  resigned,  and  the</span><span>  Spcal  or  dulv  appointed  a  Minis'  ii</span><span>  n  ember  (Mr  Fincham,  of  Lallat  tt  W  est)</span><span>  m  his  place  Ino  petitions  havo  to  bo</span><span>  disposed  of  Dr  Madden  ha3  be^n</span><span>  jetitioned  a0unst  on  tho  giound  of</span><span>  treating  at  Sandnd0e,  and  the  action  of</span><span>  the  returning  oilicei  in  disqualifying  a</span><span>  undulate  is  said  to  have  tendered  the</span></p> <p><span>  1  uihity  election  aoid  Hie  Government</span></p> <p><span>  Ins  also  io  constituted  boaids  in  the</span></p> <p><span>  inteiosts  of  its  party,  and  has  taken  the</span><span>  extreme  step  of  dismissing  Mi  \\V  LI</span><span>  Greene,  resident  engineer  of  the  Victon  m</span><span>  railwajs,  and  of  appouitni-,  m  lus  place</span><span>  a?  engineer  of  construction  Mi  R  G</span><span>  Joid,  in  whom  thoeii0nieei  m  chief,  Mi</span></p> <p><span>  Thomas  Higinbotham,  declared  he  could</span><span>  have  no  confidence,  and  against  whose</span><span>  appointment  he  strongly  protested.</span><span>  The  death  of  Mr.  Thos.

IIi0inbotliam</span><span>  engineer  in  chief,  had  expired  suddenly</span><span>  during  the  morning  Hie  news  proved  to</span><span>  be  true  Mr  Hi(,inbotl  am  was  found  dead</span><span>  in  his  bed  at  the  bouBe  of  his  brother,  Mr</span><span>  Justice  Higinbotharn,  with  whom  he  had</span><span>  long  resided  Medical  advice  was  at  on<-e</span><span>  obtuined,  but  tlio  doctor  could  only  say</span><span>  that  life  was  extinct,  and  that  the  cause  of</span><span>  death  was  probably  apoplexy  Mr  Higm</span><span>  botham  entered  tho  Government  service</span><span>  in  Januars  ISJS  immedi  itely  after  his</span><span>  arrival  from  I  ngland,  and  was  subsequently</span><span>  appointed  engineer  in  chief  ni  Muj,  lbbO  Ile</span><span>  took  charge  of  the  mam  trunk  lines  which</span><span>  wire  approaching  completion,  and  our  other</span><span>  railways  were  all  designed  and  constructed</span><span>  by  him  Gradually  the  coat  was  reduced</span><span>  to  less  than  \u00a33,000  per  mile  but  the  public</span><span>  felt  always  that,  whether  the  work  cost  little</span><span>  or  much  it  was  thorough  of  its  kind.  Mr.</span><span>  Higinbotham  stood  almost  alone  in  resisting</span><span>  a  break  of  gauge  in  our  national  railways,  and</span><span>  he  carried  his  point  against  the  Ministry  of</span><span>  the  day.  His  personal  courtesy  was  as  marked</span><span>  as  was  his  inflexible  integrity,  and  endeared</span><span>  him  to  the  service  which  looked  up  to  him</span><span>  as  its  head.  Recent  events  in  the  department</span><span>  greatly  discomposed  Mr.  Higinbotham,</span><span>  and  a  few  day  8  preceding  his  death  he  consulted</span><span>  his  friends  as  to  whether  he  should  retain  his</span><span>  position  or  not.  They  had  no  idea  however,</span><span>  that  his  health  was  in  any  way  failing  and</span><span>  his  sudden  decease  came  as  a  shock  to  all.</span></p> <p><span>  The  post-mortem  examination  showed  the</span><span>  cause  of  death  to  be  effusion  of  serum  in  the</span><span>  cavities  of  the  heart  and  on  the  brain.
