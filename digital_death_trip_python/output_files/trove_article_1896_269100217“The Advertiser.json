It  -is  now  many  years</span><span>  since  the  proposal  for  the  establish</span></p> <p><span>  ment  of  a  State  Bank  in  Victoria</span><span>  was  first  mooted;  but  it  appeared</span><span>  to  have  been  lost  sight  of  during</span><span>  the  land  and  silver  booms,  when</span><span>  the  necessity  for  any  such  institu</span><span>  tion  was  not  felt  by  those  who</span><span>  were  accumulating  vast  fortunes\u2014</span><span>  on  paper\u2014through  the  medium  of</span><span>  the  syndicates  that,  with  members</span></p> <p><span>  of  Parliament  at  the  head  of  their</span><span>  directorates,  dealt  with  thousands</span><span>  in  a  much  lighter  manner  than  the</span><span>  ordinary  citizen  in  these  days  re</span><span>  gards  a  single  pound.  But  the</span></p> <p><span>  stress  of  the  times  has  sobered</span><span>  us  and  caused  us  to  indulge  in  cool</span><span>  and  calm  reflection  ;  and  our</span><span>  legislators  give  recognition  to  the</span></p> <p><span>  fact  that  the  first  aid  to  the  further</span><span>  development  of  the  resources  of</span><span>  the  country  must  be  cheap  money.</span><span>  The  Government  Bill,  we  are  told,</span><span>  is  drawn  with  the  double  object  of</span><span>  establishing  a  State  Bank  and</span><span>  amalgamating  the  Post-office  and</span><span>  Commissioners\u2019  Savings  -  banks.</span><span>  That  step  has,  of  course,  every</span><span>  thing  to  commend  it;  indeed,  it</span><span>  would  be  absurd  to  have  running</span><span>  at  one  and  the  same  time  three</span></p> <p><span>  separate  and  distinct  institutions,</span><span>  practically  under  the  one  head.</span><span>  The-measure  provides  for  raising</span><span>  by  mortgage  bonds  a  fund  to  be</span><span>  placed  at  the  disposal  of  the  Com</span><span>  missioners  of  Savings-banks  for</span><span>  advances;  for  making  advances  at</span></p> <p><span>  reasonable  rates,  on  convenient</span><span>  terms,  and  upon  proper  securities  ;</span><span>  and  for  keeping  separate  and  dis</span><span>  tinct  accounts  relating  to  the</span><span>  Savings-bank  department,  the  ad</span><span>  vances  department,  and  the  issue</span><span>  and  banking  branch  of  the  State</span><span>  Bank,  which  it  is  arranged  shall</span><span>  have  the  following  general  powers  :</span><span>  To  receive  money  on  current</span><span>  account  and  invest  the  same  as</span></p> <p><span>  hereafter  mentioned,  and  to  repay  !</span><span>  the  same  without  interest;  to</span><span>  establish  agencies  of  the  bank  at</span><span>  any  post-office  or  elsewhere  in  Vic</span></p> <p><span>  toria  or  in  London;  to  act  as</span><span>  banker  for  any  other  bank;  to</span><span>  purchase,  take  on  lease,  or  other</span><span>  wise  acquire,  and  sell,  demise  or</span><span>  otherwise  dispose  of  for  the  pur</span><span>  pose  of  carrying  on  the  business  of</span><span>  the  bank,  any  real  or  personal</span><span>  property;  to  maintain,  repair  and</span><span>  improve  any  real  or  personal</span><span>  property  of  the  bank;  and  to</span><span>  exercise  all  such  incidental</span><span>  powers  as  shall  be  necessary  to</span><span>  carry  on  the  business  of  the  bank,</span><span>  which  is  to  be  managed  by  the</span><span>  Savings-banks  commissioners,  who</span><span>  in  payment  of  their  services  are  to</span><span>  receive  a  guinea  a  meeting,  but  no</span><span>  commissioner  is  to  get  more  than</span><span>  ^105  in  a  year  for  attendance  fees.</span><span>  An  inspector-general,  at  a  salary</span><span>  of  \u00a31000  per  annum,  is  to  be  ap</span><span>  pointed.  The  State  Bank  is  to</span><span>  hold  all  Government  moneys  and</span><span>  the  State  account,  and  may  issue</span><span>  notes  ranging  in  value  from  10s</span><span>  to^ioo,  which  notes  will  not  be</span><span>  liable  to  duty  and  are  made  legal</span><span>  tender.  A  branch  of  the  bank  is</span><span>  to  be  established  for  the  reception</span><span>  of  current  accounts,  which  may  be</span><span>  operated  on  by  cheque;  and  cor</span><span>  porations  and  societies  are  per</span></p> <p><span>  mitted  to  have  current  accounts</span></p> <p><span>  with  the  bank,  but  no  interest  is  to</span><span>  be  allowed  thereon.  When  ap</span><span>  praising  the  actual  value  of  any</span><span>  property,  valuators  are  to  carefully</span><span>  consider  its  clear  income-earning</span><span>  capacity  utilised  for  pastoral  or</span><span>  agricultural  purposes  in  average</span><span>  seasons  and  markets,  having  due</span><span>  regard  to  depreciation  where  ne</span><span>  cessary,  and  the  cost  of  such  arti</span><span>  ficial  fertilisers  as  may  be  necessary</span><span>  to  prevent  appreciable  depreciation</span><span>  in  the  quality  and  value  of  the</span><span>  land.  The  total  appraised  actual</span><span>  value  of  such  property  shall  in  no</span><span>  case  exceed  (a)  twenty-five  times</span><span>  the  clear  annual  income  earning</span><span>  capacity  of  the  land  in  the  case  of</span><span>  land  used  exclusively  for  pastoral</span><span>  purposes,  nor  (b)  twenty  times  the</span><span>  clear  annual  income-earniDg  capa</span><span>  city  of  the  land  in  the  case  of  land</span><span>  used  for  agricultural  purposes.  In</span><span>  the  case  of  land  which  has  acquired</span><span>  a  special  increase  of  value  by</span><span>  reason  of  being  cultivated  as  vine</span><span>  yards,  hop  grounds,  orchards  or</span><span>  fruit  growing  plantations,  or  for</span><span>  other  like  purposes,  the  \u2019value  of</span><span>  such  land  shall  be  based  upon  its</span><span>  clear  income-earning  capacity  if</span><span>  utilised  for  the  production  of  ordi</span><span>  nary  cereal,  pulse  or  root  crops,  or</span><span>  for  pastoral  purposes.  Having</span><span>  given  these  few  details  as  to  the</span><span>  nature  of  the  Bill,  we  await  with</span><span>  much  interest  the  deliberations  of</span><span>  hon.  members  to  whom  the  Premier</span><span>  has  set  no  light  task  in  giving</span><span>  due  consideration  to  the  pro</span><span>  visions  of  a  measure  that  is  the</span><span>  most  intricate  that  has  of  late  years</span><span>  been  placed  before  them.</span></p> <p><span>  The  Tatura  Show.\u2014We  have  again</span><span>  to  remind  our  readers  of  the  Tatura  Show,</span><span>  which  takes  place  next  Wednesday  and</span><span>  Thursday.

Many  novel  and</span><span>  interesting  features  will  this  year  be  intro</span><span>  duced,  the  committee  and  their  energetic</span><span>  secretary,  Mr  Luke  Flanagan,  being  fully</span><span>  alive  to  the  fact  that  the  more  attrac</span><span>  tions  they  can  offer  to  the  public  the</span><span>  greater  is  the  interest  taken  in  the  show.</span><span>  On  the  first  day  there  will  be  a  chaffcutting</span><span>  contest,  sheep-dog  trials,  and  other  addi</span><span>  tions  to  the  ordinary  show  programme  ;</span><span>  while  the  trials  of  hunters  and  pony</span><span>  jumping  promise  this  year  to  be  particu</span><span>  larly  good,  some  first-class  animals  being</span><span>  engaged.

From  the  1st</span><span>  September  to  the  12th  inst.  the  factory</span><span>  has  forwarded  to  Melbourne  for  export</span><span>  53J  tons  of  butter,  of  which  42  ton3  have</span><span>  been  shipped  to  London,  by  the  ss.

All  sections  of  the</span><span>  community  assembled,  and  had  evidently</span><span>  made  up  their  minds  to  have  an  enjoyable</span><span>  afternoon.  The  ladies  were  most  promi</span><span>  nently  to  the  fore  in  the  whole  arrange</span><span>  ments,  and  spared  no  trouble  in  catering</span><span>  for  the  pleasure  of  all.  The  members  and</span><span>  their  friends  rolled  up  in  force,  the  att*  n</span><span>  dance  numbering  between  GO  and  70,  and</span><span>  several  new  members  were  enrolled.  After</span><span>  noon  tea  was  indulged  in  by  all.
