The  recital  of</span><span>  their  grievances  recalls  attention  to</span><span>  the  events  that  preceded  the  strike,</span><span>  and  that  marked  its  first  stages.  It</span><span>  must  never  be  forgotten  that  boycotting</span><span>  on  a  large  scale  was  threatened  in  the</span><span>  most  reckless  and  unscrupulous  fashion.</span><span>  Despite  every  protest  the  shearers  in-</span><span>  voked  the  aid  of  the  other  unionists  to</span><span>  block  the  shipment  of  non-union  wool,  and</span><span>  an  immense  disturbance  to  the  shipping</span><span>  interest  was  threatened,  simply  that  a</span><span>  few  shearers  who  desired  to  earn  an</span><span>  honest  living  on  their  own  terms'might</span><span>  be  forced  either  into  joining  the  union</span><span>  or  leaving  their  work  altogether.  Nor</span><span>  is  it  possible  to  forget  that  the  gas</span><span>  stokers  were  called  out  for  the  sole</span><span>  purpose  of  coercing  the  company  into</span><span>  acceding  to  every  demand  of  the</span><span>  unions.  It  was  then  the  policy  of  the</span><span>  strike  committee  to  sacrifice  the  public</span><span>  comfort  and  convenience  in  the  hope  of</span><span>  obtaining  a  partial  victory  by  this  un-</span><span>  necessary,  unjust,  and  cruel  method.</span><span>  The  Trades-hall  leaders  now  say  that  the</span><span>  method  of  trades  unionism  is  persuasion.</span><span>  To  unionism  which  rests  upon  per-</span></p> <p><span>  suasion,  which  uses  only  legitimate  means</span><span>  of  convincing  the  free  labourer,  and</span><span>  which  does  not  boycott  either  the</span><span>  employer  or  the  workman,  there  could</span><span>  not  be  the  slightest  objection  in  any</span><span>  quarter.  But  the  two  events  to  which</span><span>  we  have  referred  meant  intimidation  in</span><span>  its  worst  form,  and  nothing  less.  Why</span><span>  should  the  wharf  labourers  threaten  to</span><span>  strike  if  they  were  asked  to  handle  a</span><span>  bale  of  non-union  wool  ;  why  were</span><span>  the  gas  stokers  called  out  as  soon</span><span>  as  a  ton  of  non-union  coal  was</span></p> <p><span>  landed  for  the  gasworks  ?  This  may  be</span><span>  euphemistically  described  as  persuasion,</span><span>  but  it  exactly  corresponds  to  that  moral</span><span>  suasion  which  consists  in  starving  a  be-</span><span>  sieged  town  into  submission.  Then,</span><span>  again,  when  the  strike  began  an  effort</span><span>  was  made  to  deprive  the  free  labourers,</span><span>  who  had  the  courage  to  enter  into  a  legiti-</span><span>  mate  calling,  of  the  very  necessaries</span><span>  of  life.  This  may  also  be  persuasion,</span><span>  but  it  reminds  one  of  the  method  in</span><span>  which  a  heretical  prisoner  used  to  be</span><span>  converted  by  refusing  him  food.  Ac-</span><span>  cordingly  the  employers  have  banded</span><span>  themselves  together  to  resist  intimida-</span><span>  tion.  They  have  made  no  attack  upon</span><span>  unionism  ;  they  simply  refuse  to  submit</span><span>  to  the  tyranny  of  those  irresponsible</span><span>  and  mischief-making  committees  by</span><span>  which  the  working  classes  have  been</span></p> <p><span>  misled.</span></p> <p><span>  In  this  policy  there  are  three  dis-</span><span>  tinct  issues,  which  are  set  forth  at</span><span>  length  in  the  resolutions.  It  is  obviously</span><span>  the  first  duty  of  the  employers</span><span>  to  protect  the  men  who  are  now</span><span>  working  for  them.  The  unions  have</span><span>  no  right  to  object  to  them,  and</span><span>  still  less  right  to  intimidate  them.</span><span>  If  they  choose  to  remain  free</span><span>  they  should  be  at  liberty  to  do  so,  with-</span><span>  out  any  fear  that  they  may  be  driven</span><span>  from  their  employment.  But  as</span><span>  the  unions  have  been  habitually  used</span><span>  to  coerce  the  non-union  workman,</span><span>  the  employers  insist  further  on</span><span>  the  general  principle  that  there</span><span>  must  be  freedom  of  contract.  In</span><span>  other  words  union  men  will  be  free</span><span>  to  work  or  not  as  they  please,  and  to</span><span>  put  forward  whatever  demands  they</span><span>  may  think  fair  and  reasonable,  but  their</span><span>  power  is  not  to  be  used  to  crush  other</span><span>  labourers  out  of  existence.  And  finally,</span><span>  as  a  combination  of  unions  has  been</span><span>  threatening  to  interfere  with  the  course</span><span>  of  trade,  the  employers  pledge  them-</span><span>  selves  to  resist  any  and  every  effort  at</span><span>  any  wholesale  boycotting  of  the  sort.  If</span><span>  the  trades  unionists  are  faithful  to  the</span><span>  best  form  of  unionism,  they  should  have</span><span>  little  difficulty  in  admitting  the  sub-</span><span>  stantial  justice  of  these  propositions.</span><span>  According  to  its  best  exponents  and  its</span><span>  own  best  traditions,  unionism  is  based</span><span>  upon  persuasion.  That  form  of  it</span><span>  which  relies  upon  coercion  and  com-</span><span>  pulsion  has  sprung  up  recently,</span><span>  and  in  the  great  congress  which</span><span>  has  just  been  held  in  England  the</span><span>  representatives  of  many  societies  re-</span><span>  pudiated  it.  We  need  not  remind  the</span><span>  public  that  it  is  a  poor  cause  which</span><span>  cannot  be  advocated  by  reason,  and</span><span>  which  must  be  supported  by  force.  If</span><span>  trades  unionism  cannot  exist  without</span><span>  violence  and  intimidation,  then  it  has</span><span>  served  its  purpose,  and  the  sooner</span><span>  another  system  is  adopted  of  arranging</span><span>  the  relations  between  capital  and</span><span>  labour,  the  better  will  it  be  for</span><span>  the  community.  The  boycotting  system</span><span>  is  as  hurtful  to  the  working  classes  as</span><span>  to  the  public.  It  restricts  the  unions</span><span>  and  thereby  drives  men  out  of  employ-</span><span>  ment  who  are  unable  to  pay  high  en-</span><span>  trance  fees.  It  places  the  unions  them-</span><span>  selves  at  the  mercy  of  a  few  paid</span><span>  agitators,  whose  policy  they  have  not</span><span>  the  courage  or  the  ability  to  oppose.</span><span>  To  no  class  can  a  system  of  in-</span><span>  timidation  prove  of  real  and  lasting</span><span>  benefit.</span></p> <p><span>  To  carry  out  their  policy  the  members</span><span>  of  the  Employers'  Conference  recom-</span><span>  mend  the  formation  of  a  large  Em-</span><span>  ployers'  Union  which  would  extend</span><span>  over  the  length  and  breadth  of  Aus-</span><span>  tralia.  It  is  suggested  that  local</span><span>  councils  should  be  established  in  every</span><span>  colony,  and  that  all  these  councils</span><span>  should  be  firmly  federated.  Such  a</span><span>  union,  powerful  though  it  will  be,  has</span><span>  indeed  become  necessary.  There  can</span><span>  be  no  industrial  peace  if  the  employers</span><span>  are  divided  and  if  they  are  liable  to  be</span></p> <p><span>  attacked  singly  by  large  combinations</span></p> <p><span>  of  workmen.  Of  late  the  union  leaders</span><span>  have  even  shown  a  tendency  to  dis-</span><span>  regard  agreements  which  are  made  with</span><span>  the  employers.  The  Sydney  wharf</span><span>  labourers  broke  an  understanding,</span><span>  that  had  been  made  after  long</span><span>  and  careful  negotiations,  within  a</span><span>  few  days  after  it  had  been  formally</span><span>  adopted.  Such  a  spirit  would  de-</span><span>  stroy  enterprise  and  debar  men  from</span><span>  extending  their  business.  It  must  be</span><span>  met  in  the  only  effective  way  by  an</span><span>  organisation  which  is  strong  enough  to</span><span>  see  that  agreements  are  respected.  And,</span><span>  on  the  other  side,  those  employers  who</span><span>  are  accused  of  being  too  apt  to  take</span><span>  every  advantage  of  their  workmen</span><span>  will  be  restrained  by  the  opinion</span><span>  and  the  policy  of  the  association.</span><span>  If  there  are  two  large  unions  of  em-</span><span>  ployers  and  employed,  the  potty  little</span><span>  industrial  struggles  which  are  inces-</span><span>  santly  being  carried  on,  and  which  in</span><span>  the  aggregate  are  expensive  and  harass-</span><span>  ing,  will  probably  come  to  an  end.  And</span><span>  we  may  presume  that  the  leaders</span><span>  on  both  sides,  knowing  what  conse-</span><span>  quences  a  general  strike  would  involve,</span><span>  would  use  every  means  of  conciliation</span><span>  before  resorting  to  it.  It  remains</span><span>  to  be  seen  how  far  the  rational  method</span><span>  of  trades  unionism  will  triumph  over</span><span>  intimidation,  and  whether  the  unionists</span><span>  are  willing  to  abandon  the  boycott  and</span><span>  rely  upon  persuasion.  If  a  reasonable</span><span>  and  just  view  is  taken  of  this  important</span><span>  point,  then  the  other  matters  which  are</span><span>  in  dispute  in  the  shipping  trade  might</span><span>  speedily  be  settled  to  the  advantage  of</span></p> <p><span>  both  parties.</span></p> <p><span>  Tn  nnothor  column  we  publish  some</span><span>  trenchant  remarks  by  Mr.  R.  L.  STEVEN-</span><span>  SON,  the  well-known  and  deservedly</span><span>  popular  novelist,  upon  tho  fiction  of  tho</span><span>  present  day,  and  especially  upon  the</span><span>  tendency  to  what  is  called  realism.</span><span>  The  main  point  of  his  contention  is  that</span><span>  the  realistic  novel  is  of  necessity  an</span><span>  inaccurate  representation  of  human  life,</span><span>  and  that  a  fairer  picture  can  be  formed</span><span>  without  entering  too  elaborately  into</span><span>  details,  and  certainly  without  sketching</span><span>  minutely  the  worst  vices  of  mankind.</span><span>  No  one  can  possibly  believe  that  the</span><span>  house  described  by  Zola  in  one  of  his</span><span>  most  powerful  stories,  in  which  all  tho</span><span>  residents,  from  the  apparently  respectable</span><span>  people  on  the  first  floor  to  tho  lodgers  in</span><span>  tho  attics,  are  incessantly  engaged  in</span><span>  vicious  intrigues,  and  in  which  tho</span><span>  universal  hypocrisy  is  sickening,  is</span><span>  to  be  taken  as  a  true  type  of  Paris.  In</span><span>  presenting  his  picture,  ZOLA  has  to</span><span>  bring  the  characters  together,  whereas</span><span>  in  real  life  they  would  be  separated.</span><span>  Hypocrisy  and  vice  do  undoubtedly</span><span>  exist,  but  tho  ordinary  traveller  through</span></p> <p><span>  the  world  does  not  come  across  them  as</span></p> <p><span>  they  are  described  by  ZOLA,  unrelieved</span><span>  by  any  virtues  or  any  real  happiness.</span><span>  Neither  is  it  true  to  human  nature  to  be</span><span>  for  ever  harping  upon  the  moral  cor-</span><span>  ruptions,  the  black  spots,  which  dis-</span><span>  figure  it.  As  Mr.  STEVENSON  points</span><span>  out,  the  realistic  authors  of  France</span><span>  have  drifted  into  a  one-sided  view  of</span><span>  that  restless,  many-coloured  humanity</span><span>  which  is  the  subject  of  their  art.  Start-</span><span>  ing  with  the  theory  that  they  must  copy</span><span>  literally  from  nature,  that  it  is</span><span>  their  duty  to  describe  simply  what</span><span>  they  see,  their  gaze  is  naturally</span><span>  riveted  upon  the  innumerable  social</span><span>  impurities,  which  are  omitted  from</span><span>  more  wholesome  books.  When  they</span><span>  hear  joyous  laughter,  or  portray  the</span><span>  sunlight  in  the  fields,  they  are  unable</span><span>  to  lose  consciousness,  even  for  a  moment,</span><span>  of  tho  black  cloud  of  vice.  \"  The</span><span>  \"  moment,\"  says  Mr.  STEVENSON,</span><span>  \"  anything  enjoyable  appears  they  must</span><span>  \"  remind  the  reader  that  there  is  a  cess</span><span>  pool  under  the  kitchen  floor,  a  corpse</span><span>  \"  in  the  back  parlour  cupboard,  and  a</span><span>  \"  volcano  in  the  immediate  vicinity.  I  do</span><span>  \"  not  say  it  is  not  so  in  real  life.  I  only</span><span>  \"  say  that  in  life  nobody  cares.  If  he</span><span>  \"  is  meeting  his  sweetheart  or  combat</span><span>  \"  ing  his  enemy  at  the  moment,  cess</span><span>  \"  pool,  corpse,  and  volcano  are  all  blotted</span><span>  \"  from  his  mind.  He  does  not  look</span><span>  \"  out  of  tho  window  to  analyse  a  smell,</span><span>  \"  and  consider  the  miserable  fate  of</span><span>  \"  humanity,  or  the  geological  conditions</span><span>  \"  of  tho  earth.\"  There  are  unlovely</span><span>  things  enough  in  the  background  of</span><span>  society.  But  in  their  tragedies</span><span>  and  comedies,  in  their  loves  '\"  \u00e1nd</span><span>  quarrels,  in  their  joys  and  sorrows,</span><span>  people  are  not  constantly  thinking</span><span>  of  them.  The  realistic  novelist  is  in</span><span>  danger  of  acquiring  such  an  all-per-</span><span>  vading  consciousness  of  vice,  that  his</span><span>  observations  of  a  large  part  of  life  are</span></p> <p><span>  distorted.</span></p> <p><span>  But  among  novels  which  are  alto-</span><span>  gether  free  from  tho  faults  of  French</span><span>  fiction,  there  is  a  tendency  to  one</span><span>  sidedness  and  to  a  minuteness  of</span><span>  description  that  defeats  the  writer's</span><span>  intention.  There  are  authors  who</span><span>  seem  to  think  that  the  novel  is  a  handy</span><span>  form  of  stringing  together  a  number  of</span><span>  sermons,  others  who  use  it  to  describe</span><span>  in  what  way  a  handkerchief  might  or</span><span>  should  or  would  be  carried,  others  who</span><span>  look  upon  it  as  their  business  to  ex-</span><span>  haust  all  the  words  at  their  command  in</span><span>  describing  clouds  and  sunsets.  Thus  it</span><span>  is  that  we  get  page  after  page  of  the</span><span>  most  elaborate  descriptions,  descriptions</span><span>  of  scenery,  detailed  accounts  of  dresses,</span><span>  physiological  analyses  of  tho  heroine's</span><span>  mind,  and  all  the  hundred  and  one</span><span>  things  that  prevent  the  passions  and</span><span>  sentiments  of  tho  characters  from  being</span><span>  displayed  naturally.  The  book  is  over-</span><span>  loaded  and  tho  reader  wearied.  The</span><span>  picture  which  rises  before  his  mind  as</span><span>  he  turns  the  leaves  is  not  made  clearer</span><span>  by  tho  wealth  of  detail  in  which  the</span><span>  writer  chooses  to  indulge.  And  when,</span><span>  in  addition,  we  find,  as  we  find  in  the</span><span>  ordinary  young  lady's  novel,  that  the</span><span>  most  humdrum  conversations  of  society</span><span>  are  repeated,  that  there  are  formal</span><span>  visits  with  tho  usual  questions</span><span>  about  sisters  and  cousins  and  aunts,</span><span>  when  tho  most  trifling  incident</span><span>  of  an  extremely  decorous  household</span><span>  is  made  to  extend  over  chapters,  then</span><span>  tho  mere  minuteness  becomes  unspeak-</span><span>  ably  and  exasperatingly  dreary.  The</span><span>  greatest  genius  could  not  save  such  a</span></p> <p><span>  book  from  dulness.</span></p> <p><span>  A  novel  is  not  necessarily  a  literal</span><span>  reproduction  of  what  the  author  may</span><span>  have  observed  in  any  domain  of  human</span><span>  life.  It  should  be  a  picture  of  passion</span><span>  and  sentiment  and  character,  reasonably</span><span>  true  to  nature,  and  so  arranged  by  the</span><span>  skill  of  the  author  as  to  be  above  all</span><span>  things  interesting.  For  this  purpose</span><span>  there  is  no  special  need  of  a  mass  of</span><span>  details.  It  might  be  difficult,  for  in-</span><span>  stance,  to  meet  a  DANDIE  DINMONT</span><span>  in  real  life,  but  the  blustering</span><span>  good-hearted  Border  farmer  is  the</span><span>  type  of  a  whole  class,  and  to</span><span>  this  day  he  may  be  occasionally</span><span>  recognised  under  very  different  circum-</span><span>  stances.  Few  people  have  over  seen</span><span>  CALEB  BALDERSTONE  in  the  flesh,  but  he</span><span>  is  a  character  of  extreme  interest  as  the</span><span>  ideal,  as  tho  best  type,  of  a  devoted</span><span>  class  of  servant,  which  tho  traditions  of</span><span>  an  earlier  age  created.  It  is  needless</span><span>  to  multiply  instances.  We  may  say</span><span>  that  a  novel  should  contain  types  of</span><span>  character.  Many  details  may  be</span><span>  omitted,  tho  descriptions  can  be  cut</span><span>  down,  tho  vices  of  the  world  can  be</span><span>  assailed  without  being  catalogued  and</span><span>  portrayed  in  all  their  hideousness.  It</span><span>  is  enough  to  appeal  to  tho  great  pas-</span><span>  sions  and  desires  of  mankind.  ACHILLES</span><span>  would  have  been  insignificant  if</span><span>  the  old  Greek  poet  had  given  minute</span><span>  descriptions  of  every  day  of  his</span><span>  life  and  of  every  motive  that</span><span>  crossed  his  mind.  The  elements  of  a</span></p> <p><span>  story  should  be  important,  interesting</span><span>  in  themselves.  Such,  at  least,  is  Mr,</span><span>  STEVENSON'S  view.  \"  In  the  idealists</span><span>  \"  summary  practice\u2014looking  always  at</span><span>  \"  the  characters  and  the  passion,  getting</span><span>  \"  over  the  ground,  despising  detail,  and</span><span>  \"  appealing  to  tho  strong  and  common</span><span>  \"  sentiments  directly\u2014I  contend  that</span><span>  \"  we  get  in  more  of  men  and  more  of</span><span>  \"  life.  While  tho  realist,  with  his  ner</span><span>  \"  vous  shrinking  from  commonplace</span><span>  \"  sentiments,  with  his  studious  devo</span><span>  \"  tion  to  material  facts,  to  verbal  in-</span></p> <p><span>  \"  genuities,  and  to  unexpected  dis</span></p> <p><span>  \"  closures  of  man's  stupidity  and  de</span><span>  \"  pravity  and  life's  unpleasantnesses,</span><span>  \"  expresses  less,  and  that  less  important</span><span>  \"  of  both.\"  In  other  words,  if  an  author</span><span>  appeals  to  strong  and  common  senti-</span><span>  ments,  literature  will  be  pure,  and  it  will</span><span>  be  more  forcible  and  more  lasting  than</span><span>  anything  that  is  composed  by  resorting</span><span>  to  artificial  devices  for  stimulating  an</span><span>  unhealthy  interest  in  the  work.</span></p> <p><span>  ITowever  true  it  may  bo  in  certain</span><span>  special  sonses  that  \"  tho  individual</span><span>  \"withers\"  while  \"the  world  is  more</span><span>  \"and  moro,\"  it  cannot  be  said  that</span><span>  literary  productions  evince  any  decay</span><span>  of  our  interest  in  the  individual  or  of</span><span>  tho  individual's  interest  in  himself.</span><span>  There  are,  on  the  contrary,  convincing</span><span>  proofs  that  the  private  life,  habits,  feel-</span><span>  ings,  and  character  of  our  felloe</span><span>  creatures  aro  matters  concerning  which</span><span>  contemporary  curiosity  is  peculiarly</span><span>  keon.  And  not  only  is  it  common  to</span><span>  find  a  gratification  in  discovering  what</span><span>  other  men  eat  and  drink  and  think,</span><span>  what  thoy  wear  and  iiow  they  behave</span><span>  1  themselves  ;  it  is  becoming  equally</span><span>  common  to  find  a  gratification  in</span><span>  publishing  such  information  concerning</span><span>  oneself.
