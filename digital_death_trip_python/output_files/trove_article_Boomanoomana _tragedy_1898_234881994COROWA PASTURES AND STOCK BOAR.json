I  have  slightly  im</span><span>  proved  the  box  in  this  abaft,  and  to-day</span><span>  It  la  working  much  better,  Tho  pump  is</span><span>  working  smoothly;  We  have  had  very</span><span>  lUtle  increase  of  water  this  woek.  The</span><span>  inking  now  is  in  much  coarser  drift.</span><span>  A  Tbxble  Traqedy.\u2014  A  terrible  tra</span><span>  gedy  was  enacted  on  Queen's  Birthday  at</span><span>  Forstor,  a  town  on  tho  'northern  coast.</span><span>  At  mid-day,  when  almost  the  whole  of  the</span><span>  residents  were  taking  part  in  the  Oddfel</span><span>  lows'  sports,  a  half-caste  named  John</span><span>  Field  attacked  his  wife  and  his  child,  aged</span><span>  eight  years,  with-.a  tomahawk.  With  a</span><span>  few  deadly  strokes  he  despatched  the  wo-</span></p> <p><span>  man,  and  then  haviug  cruelly  slaughtered</span><span>  the  child,  ho  proceeded  to  cut  his  bwn</span><span>  throat.  While  doing  so,  two  half-casto</span><span>  women,  who  had  ust  returned  from  tbo</span><span>  sports,  entered  Field's  camp.  As  soon  as</span><span>  he  saw  them  ho  rushed  at  them  with  tho</span><span>  tomahawk,  though  blood  was  streaming</span><span>  from  tbo  wound  in  his  throat.  The  women</span><span>  flod  shrieking  for  assistance,  whereupon</span><span>  Field  ro-enterod  his  hut.  There  ho  caught</span><span>  light  of  hii  three-months'  old  baby,  lying</span><span>  in  its  cot,  aud  he  smashed  It  over  the  head</span><span>  with;  the  tomahawk,  Inflicting  a  wound</span><span>  1  from  which  tbe  brain  protrudes.  Though</span><span>  the  infant  is  still  alive,  there  is  little  hope</span><span>  >,  of  its  recovery.  The  murderer  was  see-</span><span>  ured,  and  all  possible  aid  was  given  to</span><span>  him  and  tho  infant.  He,  however,  died</span><span>  within  ten  minutes.  The  causo  assigned</span><span>  for  tho  murder  is  jealousy'  Field  wdh  a</span><span>  wheelwright,  and  only  lately  arrived  from</span><span>  tho  Manning.  Whilo  tho  tragedy  was</span><span>  taking  place,  a  number  of  visitors  from</span><span>  tho  surrouuding  district  were  enjoying</span><span>  themselves  at  a  pic-nic  in  apddock  ad</span><span>  joining  the  camp,  and  tho  news  ureatod  a</span><span>  most  painful  sensation.-  '</span></p> "}
