The  King  can  do  no  wrong,\"</span><span>  but  his  Majesty  can  abrogate  his  rights,</span><span>  and  race  under  the  rules  like  any  of  his</span><span>  subjects.  His  Majesty  the  King  of  England</span><span>    is  a  sportsman,  and  if  a  horse  of  his</span></p> <p><span>  or  a  servant  did  wrong  he  would  be  the  first</span><span>    to  want  the  stewards  to  go  into  the</span><span>  matter,  for  he  would  recall  the  old  saying,</span></p> <p><span>  commonly  ascribed  to  Lord  George  Ben-  '</span><span>  truck,  over  and  under  the  turf  all  men</span><span>  are  equal.\"  At  the  Newmarket  meeting</span><span>  his  Majesty's  ch  colt.  Sunny  Lake,  by</span><span>  Sundridge Pearl  of  the  Loch,  won  the</span><span>  Wood  Ditton  Stakes.

After  the</span><span>  race  the  stewards,  Mr.  Lambton  (acting  for</span><span>  Captain  Greer),  and  Lords  Wolverton  and</span><span>  Villiers,  enquired  into  the  circumstances</span><span>  of  Sunny  Lake  swerving.  They  expressed</span><span>  themselves  satisfied  that  he  was  far  enough</span><span>  in  front  at  the  time  not  to  interfere  with</span><span>  any  of  the  other  horses.  An  English</span><span>  writer  said,  by  way  of  comment: It  is</span><span>  singular  that  the  first  consultation  of  the</span><span>  new  trio  of  Jockey  Club  stewards  should</span><span>  have  to  hold  concerned  the  running  of  a</span><span>  Royal  winner,  but  happily  Mr.  Lambton,</span><span>  Lord  Wolverton,  and  Lord  Villiers,  found</span><span>  no  necessity  to  alter  the  verdict  in  the</span><span>  Wood  Ditton  Stakes  The  enquiry  concerned</span><span>    the  swerving  of  Sunny  Lake,\"  but  it</span><span>  was  found  that  the  Egerton  House  candidate</span><span>    was  too  far  in  front  at  the  time  to</span><span>  have  interfered  with  any  of  his  rinds.\"</span></p> <p><span>  Captain  McCalmont,  the  owner  of  The</span><span>  Tetrarch,  sustained  a  heavy  fall  early  in</span><span>  April  at  the  West  Kilkenny  Point-to-Point</span><span>    races.  His  mount  lay  on  him  for</span><span>  some  time,  but  fortunately  Captain  McCalmont</span><span>    escaped  injury.

The</span><span>  mare  crossed  her  legs  on  the  mat.  and  Captain</span><span>    McCalmont  was  temporarily  knocked!</span><span>  out.
