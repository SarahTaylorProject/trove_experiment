When did you know, that the powerlines were broken 
Where did you go, when the suburbs sank from the sky 
And why did you hold those stones and throw away the diamonds 
Dead flowers by the roadside 

Who did you meet, as you were driving through the wonders 
And what did they steal that you hadn't already lost 
And how many times did you cry to me, when it all went south 
Dead flowers by the roadside 

Twilight changes as you fill your years
Days get short and nights come and go 
And a movie reel seems to spin, so much faster 
As it heads towards the end of the show 

How could it be, that your desperate friends were riding 
To hide from your seek, until you found them ready or not 
So why did you still thread your gold into their rusting wires 
Dead flowers by the roadside 
Dead flowers by the roadside 

Donâ€™t give your enemies too much time
That way you let the bastards win 
Cos we're less unkillable, than we used to be 
Now that time has become a sniper 

There are only two stories: either a person goes on a journey 
Or else a stranger, a stranger comes into town 
If that's how it is, then I will be that stranger 
Planting flowers by the roadside 
New flowers by the roadside 
Flowers by the roadside
