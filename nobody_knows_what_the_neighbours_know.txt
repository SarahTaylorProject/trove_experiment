Welcome to Elmore, we hope you stay a while
Our house was the R.S.L, it has acoustic tiles
Here is the window where the birds like to sit
Here is the rug where the cat did a shit
There goes the lady, she walks past every day
Yes, sheâ€™d like to pat the dog, and yes, she is insane
Nobody knows what the neighbours know
Nobody knows what the neighbours know
Go to the bakery for a vegemite scroll
Bread is just a dollar if you buy it one day old
There goes a cattle truck, it smells bad
Here is a swing that swings when no one is around
There is the house that burnt down to the ground
They were smoking in the bed, his wife was not around
Nobody knows what the neighbours know
Nobody knows what the neighbours know
Here is the beanbag where Andrew took a trip
We think that in retrospect it broke his brain a bit
There is the house selling a lawnmower
We thought it was just the one, but now there's always more
Look into the yard where the ferrets used to live
When the family moved away we asked about the kids
Nobody knows what the neighbours know
Nobody knows what the neighbours know
Welcome to Elmore, we hope you stay a while
Our house was the R.S.L, it has acoustic tiles
Here is the window where the birds like to sit
Here is the rug where the cat did a shit
