Job seekers and ParentsNext participants could get demerits and financial penalties for not meeting mutual obligation requirements without a valid reason

Who this applies to
Demerits and financial penalties for not meeting mutual obligation requirements under the Targeted Compliance Framework apply to:

job seekers in jobactive and Disability Employment Services, and
ParentsNext participants

Your payments will stop if you don't meet your mutual obligation requirements 
You'll also get a demerit each time you miss a requirement without a valid reason

Each demerit lasts 6 months from the date you get it

If you get 5 demerits in 6 months you may move to the penalty zone 
This means if you miss any more requirements, you risk:

You may move to the penalty zone sooner than this if you don't turn up to a job interview

Know where you're at
The Department of Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business have developed an online dashboard to help you

keep on track with meeting your requirement
be aware of your compliance status
You can access the dashboard from your JobSearch account on the jobactive website 
You can also find out more about the compliance system by watching the videos on the jobactive website

In the green zone
You'll start in the green zone with no demerits

You're responsible for making sure you're meeting all the requirements in your plan 
This means you need to go to appointments, activities and interviews arranged by your provider, 
and record your job search efforts and attendance at activities and appointments
If you can't go to an appointment or activity you need to talk to your provider beforehand 
If you miss a requirement, your payment will stop until you talk to your provider

If you don't have a valid reason for missing the requirement your provider will give you a demerit 
You'll also need to meet the requirement you missed before your payment starts again

In the warning zone
Each time you miss a requirement without a valid reason you'll get a demerit 
If you have 1 or more demerits you'll be in the warning zone

If you disagree with a demerit you need to talk to your provider about it 
We can't change or remove demerits

You'll need to have a capability interview with your provider if you get 3 demerits in 6 months, 
or don't turn up to a job interview
Your provider will refer you to us for a Capability Assessment if you get 5 demerits in 6 months
or sooner if you don't turn up to a job interview

At the Capability Assessment you'll have a chance to discuss the reasons you haven't met your requirements
identify issues, and review your job plan and make sure you can meet your requirements
If it's found that your requirements are appropriate, you'll move to the penalty zone

What happens in the penalty zone
In the penalty zone there are no demerits 
Instead you'll get a financial penalty if you don't meet your requirements and don't have a reasonable excuse

This means you will lose half of your fortnightly payment for the first penalty
lose all of your fortnightly payment for the second penalty, and
have your payment cancelled if you get a third penalty
We can't waive these penalties

If you do the right thing for 3 months, you'll return to the green zone with no demerits

What other penalties apply
You could have your payment cancelled if you get a work refusal or unemployment failure 
This applies even if you don't have any demerits 
These cancellations don't affect family payments 
These 2 failures don't apply if you're taking part in ParentsNext

Work refusal failure
You may get a work refusal failure if you don't accept a suitable job offer
or start a job you've accepted
A work refusal failure means you'll have your payment cancelled

Unemployment failure
You may get an unemployment failure if you:

choose to leave your job without a valid reason, or
lose your job due to misconduct
An unemployment failures means you won't get a payment for 4 weeks, 
or 6 weeks if you got relocation assistance for the job from your provider
What you need to do if your payment is cancelled
If your payment is cancelled, you need to submit a new claim using your Centrelink online account through myGov 
You need to wait at least 4 weeks before you get a payment 
You may also need to serve other waiting periods

Using your Health Care Card
If you already have a Heath Care Card, you can keep using it even if you've have a penalty applied

How to avoid penalties
If you're finding it hard to meet your requirements, it's important to let your provider know 
If you don't have a provider talk to us instead 
You need to do this before you get a demerit or financial penalty

You can avoid penalties by doing the things you've agreed to in your plan such as:

going to all your appointments and compulsory activities
telling your provider before your appointment or activity if you can't attend it
agreeing to or changing your plan if asked
not leaving a job, training course or program without a valid reason
showing you're actively looking for suitable paid work
accepting suitable job offers
going to job interviews
If you don't agree with a demerit or penalty
If you disagree with a demerit, you need to talk to your provider 
We can't change or remove demerits

If you disagree with a financial penalty or payment cancellation you can ask us to review the decision 
If this happens, you won't get a payment until we finish the review
