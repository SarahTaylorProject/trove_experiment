Performance Career Plan
At RMIT, achieving our Ready for Life and Work 2020 strategy depends on you!

As an employee of RMIT, you have the tools, resources and support to drive your career journey forward.

that helps you assess your current skills and create an individually-tailored development plan for you to achieve your goals
