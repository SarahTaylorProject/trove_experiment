BACTERIA

The sadness of biology has followed us for centuries
The news in the town, diphtheria was found
In the house on the plain, one child remained
Send her to her grandparents, they said, send that child away
But the monster followed anyway, the sadness of biology, it knows the way
It knows no other way

Oh my darling, pack her things, send her somewhere they won't get in
Her brothers and her sisters, our efforts come to naught
Our stones in a circle, in a quiet spot
You raise them up on mother's milk, you hold them, feed them, watch them while they sleep
But the fever takes them anyway, the sadness of biology, it knows the way
It knows no other way

From the well in the night, they come on their unseen flight
To the kitchen she was born, to the Monday she was gone
The sadness of biology has followed us for centuries, it knows the way
The sadness of biology has followed us for centuries, it knows the way
The sadness of biology has followed us for centuries, it knows no other way

You spend your lifetime swatting flies and running from bacteria that strike when you're down
You spend your lifetime swatting flies and running from bacteria that strike when you're down
They raise armies in your towels
