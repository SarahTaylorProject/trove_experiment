Let me take you to the place where membership's a smiling face
Brush shoulders with the stars
Where strangers take you by the hand
And welcome you to wonderland from beneath their panamas
Club Tropicana, drinks are free
Fun and sunshine, there's enough for everyone
All that's missing is the sea
But don't worry, you can suntan
Castaways and lovers meet
Then kiss in Tropicana's heat
Watch the waves break on the bay
Oh, soft white sands, a blue lagoon
Cocktail time, a summer's tune
A whole night's holiday
Club Tropicana, drinks are free
Fun and sunshine, there's enough for everyone
All that's missing is the sea
But don't worry, you can suntan
Club Tropicana, drinks are free
Fun and sunshine, there's enough for everyone
All that's missing is the sea
But don't worry, you can suntan
Pack your bags
And leave tonight
Don't take your time
Gotta move your feet, don't you miss the flight
Pack your bags
And leave tonight
Don't take your time
Gotta move your feet, don't you miss the flight
(Cool, cool)
(Cool, cool)
Club Tropicana, drinks are free
Fun and sunshine, there's enough for everyone
All that's missing is the sea
But don't worry, you can suntan
