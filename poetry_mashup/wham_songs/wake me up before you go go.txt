You put the boom-boom into my heart
You send my soul sky-high
When your lovin' starts
Jitterbug into my brain
Goes a bang-bang-bang
'Til my feet do the same
But something's bugging me
Something ain't right
My best friend told me
What you did last night
You left me sleeping in my bed
I was dreaming
But I should've been with you instead
Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go, ah
Take me dancing tonight
I wanna hit that high, yeah, yeah
You take the grey skies outta my way
You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day
You turned a bright spark into a flame
My beats per minute never been the same
'Cause you're my lady
I'm your fool
It makes me crazy when you act so cruel
Come on, baby
Let's not fight
We'll go dancing
Everything will be alright
Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go, ah
Take me dancing tonight
I wanna hit that high, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby
Cuddle up, baby
Move in tight
We'll go dancing tomorrow night
It's cold out there
But it's warm in bed
They can dance
We'll stay home instead
Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't wanna miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not planning on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go, ah
Take me dancing tonight
Wake me up before you go-go
Don't you dare to leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Take me dancing
A boom-boom-boom-boom, oh!
A boom-boom-boom-boom (yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Take me dancing tonight) ooh-aah
Yeah, yeah
