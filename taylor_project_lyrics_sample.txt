UNENDING DAWN

Late in the night
and early in the morn-
ing when drunk people fight
and babies get born
is the unending dawn

Some things have an end
And some things begin again
Some things have an end
And some things begin again
In the unending dawn

And dreaming of anger
In bottomless wells
Dimming like streetlights 
to emptying bins
is the unending dawn

Some things have an end
And some things begin again
Some things have an end
And some things begin again
In the unending dawn
		
Somewhere a flight is landing
And others will arrive
Somewhere a plane is racing
Its flight path escapes the
Unending dawn

Some things have an end
And some things begin again
Some things have an end
And some things begin again
In the unending dawn
			
some break and some bend
Some things begin again
In the ending dawn
The unending dawn

ELON MUSK

And when our bodies are long gone 
A piece of us may carry on 
In tiny polaroids of DNA 
In a space ship heading off to Mars 
With the proceeds of electric cars 

The future’s always getting old 
The here and now’s already gone 
When I was young we had no HBO 
In the 1980s we got tanned 
In the 1990s we got fat 
In the late 2000s we quit smoking but 
Now the planet smokes for us 
And in Elon Musk 
We trust 

Ask any teenager who’s stoned 
To look at the stars and they will know 
There is no up, there is no down 
Just our bodies pressed against the ground 
On the ceaseless giant spinning round 

To Ellis Island dressed in rags 
Old generations made their plans 
For new beginnings in new continents 
With their bodies pressed against the boughs 
And the giant statue looking down 
Only one way tickets to be found 
Their ashes and ashes 
And dust to dust 
They sailed their ships 
Like Elon Musk 

[Creating the self-sustaining civilization on Mars would be the greatest adventure ever - ever in human history] 

The only home I’ve ever known 
Has my own fingers, my own toes 
Every piece of wet cement 
I wished I’d put my hands in it 
Because like a captain I will go down with this ship 
I see the future but it’s through a glass darkly 
It’s a green light that recedes before me year by year 
It’s a planet with my bones in it in rear view mirrors 

Ashes to ashes 
And dust to dust 
In Elon Musk we trust 

COOL CHANGE

Cool change coming round the corner 
Cool change coming round the corner 
Restless litter in the street, time is nipping at our heels 
In the morning we won’t know why we ever wore these clothes 

Cool change coming round the corner 
Cool change coming round the corner 
Waking up, venetian blinds, construction work outside 
Now the sudden need for pants like the last day of school camp 

Cool change coming round the corner 
Cool change coming round the corner 
Soon again it will be May, we’ll go to parties in the rain 
Travel plans will be arranged, get your coat and scarf again 
Just a thought and then a day, put those summer clothes away 
Always leaving things behind, always making up our minds 

Cool change coming round the corner 
Old age is coming for us


GUILTY WRETCH

I don’t know, I’ve just been told, guilty wretch that I am 
I came into the house after everything was settled 
That night we went without meat and everything was scuttled 
Three of us were cornered had to come up with a story 
One for them and one for us and one for the informants 

I don’t know, I’ve just been told, there is right, and wrong 
Look out on the corner and you’ll see a heart of darkness 
My friends were waiting for me I could see no better option 
Mother came to meet me, said that I should reconsider 
I said I’d write a story and that I would put her in it 

I don’t know, I’ve just been told, I won’t grow old 
There’s another detail that I won’t neglect to mention 
Sullivan was doing thing beyond the group’s intentions 
In the mountains behind Nelson he came forth as the true villain 
As we dug the shallow grave and took the three pounds sixteen shillings 
From a labourer we came upon the track while we were waiting 
We took those three months’ wages and we drank them down in town 
And at the tavern I could tell that he had plans to make me look bad 
But I was only robbing the Maori camp I hope you understand 
Those Jury men, they’ve just been told different laws than my own 

There are many crimes to which I’m readily confessing 
And others which I’ll spend my dying days to have corrected 
Thieves will have their owner if they hold the silence golden 
And they know the biggest rule of all is ‘always be a man’ 
And guilty wretch that I am, at least I have that


DETROIT

One morning in Manchester, I’ve never been there but I can picture it 
The kitchen scene, the flowers growing in spite of it 
The kettle boiling like puberty, tell the girls to be in time for tea 
Outside there’s boys in jeans with no need to wear sunglasses 
Staring back at me, the post industrial poster boys 
For a feeling that I sometimes have when I’m gazing up at power lines in a fading light 

That we are all Detroit, we are all Detroit 
We will all be destroyed, we will all be unemployed 
We are all Detroit, our feelings are embroiled 
We will be reborn one morning in Detroit 

Slouching to Bethlehem under blue skies in Baltimore, there is grandeur here 
Old stories will reappear under ancient signs of the groceries of the sixties 
There’s nothing quite as old as Modernity 
Each morning the sun still shines and we will ask what’s for breakfast 
Cheerios at nine, served with poverty in excess 
In the bar tonight is the unbending instinct which is not concerned with dignity 
There’s more than one way to lose your virginity 

And we are all Detroit, we are all Detroit 
We will all be destroyed, we will all be unemployed 
We are all Detroit, our feelings are embroiled 
We will be reborn one morning in Detroit 

We will all foreclose, a mix of fading-fast instinct 
And the roots and leaves of incorrigible pheromones 
On the prairie lawn we reap what we have sewn 
We click our heels and grow familiar with the mould


WAITING ON A FOOL

Still remember that feeling of waiting on a fool 
On many an evening when I was a youth I was waiting on a fool 
Those taxis and sirens were calling in the night again 

The phone is calling like a foghorn, the obscenity of spring 
Letterboxes leering, pollen is just semen, sing a journey song 
And hold on to that steering, you’re on the ship of fools again 

Scene of sunset and silos out over a plain 
On the edge of something, still so far away yet I followed like a moon 
And swam through dark waters to sirens in the night again 

I was waiting on a fool, I was waiting on a fool 
I was waiting on a fool to change their mind 
They never do 

They never do 

I was waiting on a fool, I was waiting on a fool 
I was waiting on a fool to change their mind 
They never do


THE ORCHARD

Woodman, spare that tree 
Touch not a single bough 
In youth it sheltered me and I'll protect it now 

Rule Britannia, let the wind blow over orchards that never need to dry 
Run the rivers in a straight line over land under a clear blue sky 
The plan was not to die, the plan has been revised 

Woodman, spare that tree 
Touch not a single bough 
In youth it sheltered me, and I'll protect it now 

Call up the mountains to the excavating harvest 
Machines to make a new cemetery of the fruit trees of our youth 
For all the running wild, we just fattened in the sty 
Like Menzies era pride 

[La-la-la] 
They do this when it’s green 
When happens when it’s dry? 

Woodman, spare that tree 
Touch not a single bough 
In youth it sheltered me 
But the orchard’s empty now 

Woodman, spare that tree 
Touch not a single bough 
In youth it sheltered me 
But the orchard’s empty now 
The orchard’s empty now


DOREEN

The city in the distance, and a ripple in the long grass 
An exit from the highway, and a stillness in the sunshine 
A home is like a long dream, there’s room for dreams in Doreen 
And some people dream about making amphetamines 

Doreen, Doreen, Doreen 
Turn around, turn around, Doreen 
Doreen, Doreen, Doreen 
We came here to get clean 
Please, Doreen 

The same sets of conditions that help us take it slowly 
Are also advantageous for speed laboratories 
A fondness for high fences, not too many questions 
Remove all suspicion by waving on occasion 

Doreen, Doreen, Doreen 
Turn around, turn around, Doreen 
Doreen, Doreen, Doreen 
We came here to get clean 
Please, Doreen 

An old drag on a new street, police tape on a crime scene 
A kitchen in a garage, a body beaten savage 
Police would like to speak to two men driving a white ute 
They’re asking round locally for help with inquiries 


Doreen, Doreen, Doreen 
Turn around, turn around, Doreen 
Doreen, Doreen, Doreen 
No more pessimistic scenes 
Please, Doreen 

Police said it had all the hallmarks of some sort of debt 
There’s fixed rate or there’s varied rate or there’s just a kick in the head 
It’s not supposed to be here, crime is a city thing 
I saw it in a movie; the man gives up his life of crime for a girl called 

Doreen, Doreen, Doreen 
Turn around, turn around, Doreen 
Doreen, Doreen, Doreen 
We came here to get clean 
Please, Doreen


MIGHT AS WELL BE THE MOON

This place on a Sunday might as well be the moon 
In outer space there are places less inclined to put you down 
The human race, in its wisdom 
Would sooner send a man into space than see a girl walking around alone here 
For all of the welcome she will find this might as well be the moon 

The window lace, like the red sea, parts wherever your foot will fall 
Those floating eyes in the darkness see everything but the truth 
The sidewalk sighs, you should know now 
They’re making little steps up above us 
There won’t be a television broadcast, but this might as well be the moon 

Without a trace of a footprint you’re just a shadow in a headlight 
In broken glass diamonds after midnight 
With all of these strangers that you know, this might as well be the moon


THE END OF THE AFFAIR

The church bells were ringing, announcing new resolve 
The same bells that told me that the war had been won 
Announcing to the world in their dulcet tones 
The end of the affair 
The end of the affair 

When I grow old I’ll count my money 
In silver coins and little boxes on the ground 
If I have time, I’ll count my lovers 
In silvers frames and yellow pictures of the mind 
The curtain calls, two eyes receding 
Like those above at the end of the affair 

And the church bells were ringing, announcing new resolve 
The same bells that told me that the war had been won 
Announcing to the world in their dulcet tones 
The end of the affair 
The end of the affair 


When we are gone, they’ll play our records 
And hear the sound of little voices that they find 
In place of you, they’ll read your letters 
And speculate on what is lost between the lines 
So long ago, someone was lonely 
Could hardly wait to begin the whole affair 

And the old men were singing in the hotel down the road 
And I found the perfect prayer that seemed to suit the winter mood 
Oh God, you’ve done enough, you’ve robbed me of enough 
Leave me alone forever, leave me alone forever 
At the end of the affair 
The end of the affair
