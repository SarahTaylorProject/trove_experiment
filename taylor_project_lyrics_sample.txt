WE ARE THE SWIMMERS

In the northward flowing river
We are creatures of the water
We remember that we are human
But for now we are the swimmers

Leave the car up by the old road
Let the sun set on our shoulders
In the twilight, our features fading
We are fishes, we are wading

In the northward flowing river
We are creatures of the water
We remember that we are human
But for now we are the swimmers

All around us the wooden fences
Of the old colonial farmers
We remember our aspirations
But for now the light is fading

So we might have been swimming into 
A broken window to the past
And go searching for our cars
Unholy fishes washed ashore

From the northward flowing river
We are creatures of the water
We remember that we are human
But for now we are the swimmers

We will crawl out of the water
Like the creatures long before us
When their limbs were only forming
They were fishes, they were crawling

From the northward flowing river
They were creatures of the water
Who would one day be human
But for now and ever swimmers



DON'T CRY FOR ME WANGARATTA

Don't cry for me Wangaratta
And Wangaratta I won't cry for you
For I know that in Wang that our song has been sung
And I'll look elsewhere for my ever after

Our love was like a window, bright but painful
Now it's just underpants upon the bedroom floor
And if you could take your eyes off Sixty Minutes for one minute
You'd see my bags packed by the door

We're too young for what we've gotten into
Fighting about shit that just don't matter
Somewhere along the line you lost a double U
Leaving only anger at her

Don't cry for me Wangaratta
And Wangaratta I won't cry for you
For I know that in Wang that our song has been sung
And I'll look elsewhere for my ever after

And yes I'll leave the dishes in the sink
But I'll take you out for one last drink
It's on me, like you won't be anymore

Don't cry for me Wangaratta
And Wangaratta I won't cry for you
For I know that in Wang that our song has been sung
And I'll look elsewhere
The freeway's just a K away so I can leave and you can stay
It'll Albury OK in its own way, Wangaratta


BALLARAT ON A GOOD DAY

But you should see her on a good day
When the warm wind blows from the north
And you say, oh I'll love you forever
Ballarat, but I'm leaving anyway
Oh I'll love you forever Ballarat, but I'm leaving anyway


MAKING OTHER PLANS

Oh Mary I know it's getting late and the closing lights will be showing our age
But I gotta say something before this night gets out of hand
Oh you're a beautiful girl and we've had some great nights
But lately I've been trying to know my own mind
And this morning it said I'm just not your kind of man

You'd better start making other plans
You'd better start making other plans

Tumbling and turning and quietly tying ourselves to a web that goes on without end
Through the memories and visions of hearts as frail as ours
Oh you're a beautiful girl and we've had some great nights
But lately I've been trying to know my own mind
And this morning it said I'm just not your kind of man

You'd better start making other plans
You'd better start making other plans

I know you see you leaving with me
But all I see is a door with someone else waiting for me

You'd better start making other plans
You'd better start making other plans


LOVE IN A SMALL TOWN

And love is hard in a small town
We've got to call on friends just to sleep around
But I know that after you've had everyone in town
You'll come back to me next time around
Come back to me next time around

On the main street walking and I see your handsome face in the morning sun 
And I have forgotten many things in my lifetime
But I have no intention to forget the time that you said 
Come back to my place this time around
You don't look so bad let's try it out

And I say that love is hard in a small town
We've got to call on friends just to sleep around
But I know that after you've had everyone in town
You'll come back to me next time around
Come back to me next time around

And of course they're talking
That's the cliche that's the truth
In a town like this we know, who goes home with who
And who goes home alone
But we already know, which way the cold wind blows
It blows through our bones and then to the sea

And I say that love is hard in a small town
We've got to call on friends just to sleep around
But I know that after you've had everyone in town
You'll come back to me next time around
Come back to me next time around


ANIMALS (THEY DREAM IN BLACK AND WHITE)

Oh the cold wind blows and blows
And all the sore hearted animals know that
Just as day will follow the night
They just watch their feet move from left to right
And then dream in black and white
They dream in black and white

Oh the hot sun glows and glows
And all the thirsty animals know that
If they're wrong same as if they're right
They just keep on moving from left to right
And then dream in black and white
They dream in black and white

Oh the leaves sink lower and lower
And all the waiting animals are sure that
Just as light will sink in the west
They just keep on moving, now right, now left
And then dream in black and white
They dream in black and white
They dream in black and white

And listen here you don't have to do nothing
Just watch your feet move left to right and dream in black and white


JONAH AND THE WHALE

This is the story of Jonah and the whale
And what happens when a soul runs against its fate
It started long ago when the Lord said to Jonah
You just have to do exactly as I say
But when the Lord said to sail east, oh Jonah sailed west
He didn't want to spread the gospel under duress
He thought he had nothing to do that day
And that sinking feeling would just blow away
But he kept on sailing and it only got worse
His life was like a ship with an albatross curse
The storms would break out and the ship would go down
Oh something always happened when Jonah came around

This is the story of Jonah and the whale
And what happens when a soul runs against its fate
Jonah took his promises and blew them away
He said I might dream in the night but I'm alive in the day
And what's the sense of having this sense of direction
When everybody knows that my best intentions
Will not make up for this curse now upon me
And soon no captain will ever employ me

Until one day Jonah looks out upon the bow
He sees a whale looking back at him
He says, what now?
What now Jonah?

Jo-jo-jnah and the whale
Jo-jo-jonah and the whale
You'd better turn around, you'd better turn around, turnaround now, turnaround now
I know you had places to go around town
But this is what happens when you let me down
Jo-jo-jnah and the whale
Jo-jo-jonah and the whale
You'd better turn around, you'd better turn around, turnaround now, turnaround now


SCURVY

They say there's a fog that lives on the ocean, that can make old bones become unbroken
And a scar that has healed so many years ago, can open up again like a red, red rose

On the first day sailing there were lessons to be learnt
And on the first night sailing there were tales to be heard
They said the fog was just another of the ocean's mysteries
As we settled down to dinner of corned beef and biscuits

After one month sailing there were things to be repeating
There was slimy grog and captain's logs and biscuits to be eaten
I watched a foggy sea surround me and I felt a wave upon me
Perhaps we'd gotten closer to the red, red roses

They say there's a fog in the middle of the ocean, that can make old bones become unbroken
And a scar that has healed so many years ago, can open up again like a red, red rose

After two months sailing there were pieces of me changing
My legs felt heavy and my teeth were rearranging
Between slimy grog and captain's logs I could not smell a difference
I did not want another dinner of corned beef and biscuits

After three months sailing there were pieces of me falling
My legs fell beneath me as the ropes fell upon me
They told me to work harder but my gums just got softer
So they sent me down below to the dark, dark hull

To sway to and fro in the dark, dark hull
To watch the lantern glowing in the dark, dark hull
To sway to and fro in the dark, dark hull
To watch the lantern glowing in the dark, dark hull

They say there's a time in the middle of the ocean, when one eye closes and another eye opens
And days that had gone so many years ago, can all be remembered like a red, red rose

They say there's a fog in the middle of the ocean, that can make old bones become unbroken
And a scar that has healed so many years ago, can open up again like a red, red rose



UNENDING DAWN

Late in the night
and early in the morning 
when drunk people fight
and babies get born
is the unending dawn

Some things have an end
And some things begin again
Some things have an end
And some things begin again
In the unending dawn

And dreaming of anger
In bottomless wells
Dimming like streetlights 
to emptying bins
is the unending dawn

Some things have an end
And some things begin again
Some things have an end
And some things begin again
In the unending dawn
		
Somewhere a flight is landing
And others will arrive
Somewhere a plane is racing
Its flight path escapes the
Unending dawn

Some things have an end
And some things begin again
Some things have an end
And some things begin again
In the unending dawn
			
some break and some bend
Some things begin again
In the ending dawn
The unending dawn


ELON MUSK

And when our bodies are long gone 
A piece of us may carry on 
In tiny polaroids of DNA 
In a space ship heading off to Mars 
With the proceeds of electric cars 

The future’s always getting old 
The here and now’s already gone 
When I was young we had no HBO 
In the 1980s we got tanned 
In the 1990s we got fat 
In the late 2000s we quit smoking but 
Now the planet smokes for us 
And in Elon Musk 
We trust 

Ask any teenager who’s stoned 
To look at the stars and they will know 
There is no up, there is no down 
Just our bodies pressed against the ground 
On the ceaseless giant spinning round 

To Ellis Island dressed in rags 
Old generations made their plans 
For new beginnings in new continents 
With their bodies pressed against the boughs 
And the giant statue looking down 
Only one way tickets to be found 
Their ashes and ashes 
And dust to dust 
They sailed their ships 
Like Elon Musk 

[Creating the self-sustaining civilization on Mars would be the greatest adventure ever - ever in human history] 

The only home I’ve ever known 
Has my own fingers, my own toes 
Every piece of wet cement 
I wished I’d put my hands in it 
Because like a captain I will go down with this ship 
I see the future but it’s through a glass darkly 
It’s a green light that recedes before me year by year 
It’s a planet with my bones in it in rear view mirrors 

Ashes to ashes 
And dust to dust 
In Elon Musk we trust 

COOL CHANGE

Cool change coming round the corner 
Cool change coming round the corner 
Restless litter in the street, time is nipping at our heels 
In the morning we won’t know why we ever wore these clothes 

Cool change coming round the corner 
Cool change coming round the corner 
Waking up, venetian blinds, construction work outside 
Now the sudden need for pants like the last day of school camp 

Cool change coming round the corner 
Cool change coming round the corner 
Soon again it will be May, we’ll go to parties in the rain 
Travel plans will be arranged, get your coat and scarf again 
Just a thought and then a day, put those summer clothes away 
Always leaving things behind, always making up our minds 

Cool change coming round the corner 
Old age is coming for us


GUILTY WRETCH

I don’t know, I’ve just been told, guilty wretch that I am 
I came into the house after everything was settled 
That night we went without meat and everything was scuttled 
Three of us were cornered had to come up with a story 
One for them and one for us and one for the informants 

I don’t know, I’ve just been told, there is right, and wrong 
Look out on the corner and you’ll see a heart of darkness 
My friends were waiting for me I could see no better option 
Mother came to meet me, said that I should reconsider 
I said I’d write a story and that I would put her in it 

I don’t know, I’ve just been told, I won’t grow old 
There’s another detail that I won’t neglect to mention 
Sullivan was doing thing beyond the group’s intentions 
In the mountains behind Nelson he came forth as the true villain 
As we dug the shallow grave and took the three pounds sixteen shillings 
From a labourer we came upon the track while we were waiting 
We took those three months’ wages and we drank them down in town 
And at the tavern I could tell that he had plans to make me look bad 
But I was only robbing the Maori camp I hope you understand 
Those Jury men, they’ve just been told different laws than my own 

There are many crimes to which I’m readily confessing 
And others which I’ll spend my dying days to have corrected 
Thieves will have their owner if they hold the silence golden 
And they know the biggest rule of all is ‘always be a man’ 
And guilty wretch that I am, at least I have that


DETROIT

One morning in Manchester, I’ve never been there but I can picture it 
The kitchen scene, the flowers growing in spite of it 
The kettle boiling like puberty, tell the girls to be in time for tea 
Outside there’s boys in jeans with no need to wear sunglasses 
Staring back at me, the post industrial poster boys 
For a feeling that I sometimes have when I’m gazing up at power lines in a fading light 

That we are all Detroit, we are all Detroit 
We will all be destroyed, we will all be unemployed 
We are all Detroit, our feelings are embroiled 
We will be reborn one morning in Detroit 

Slouching to Bethlehem under blue skies in Baltimore, there is grandeur here 
Old stories will reappear under ancient signs of the groceries of the sixties 
There’s nothing quite as old as Modernity 
Each morning the sun still shines and we will ask what’s for breakfast 
Cheerios at nine, served with poverty in excess 
In the bar tonight is the unbending instinct which is not concerned with dignity 
There’s more than one way to lose your virginity 

And we are all Detroit, we are all Detroit 
We will all be destroyed, we will all be unemployed 
We are all Detroit, our feelings are embroiled 
We will be reborn one morning in Detroit 

We will all foreclose, a mix of fading-fast instinct 
And the roots and leaves of incorrigible pheromones 
On the prairie lawn we reap what we have sewn 
We click our heels and grow familiar with the mould


WAITING ON A FOOL

Still remember that feeling of waiting on a fool 
On many an evening when I was a youth I was waiting on a fool 
Those taxis and sirens were calling in the night again 

The phone is calling like a foghorn, the obscenity of spring 
Letterboxes leering, pollen is just semen, sing a journey song 
And hold on to that steering, you’re on the ship of fools again 

Scene of sunset and silos out over a plain 
On the edge of something, still so far away yet I followed like a moon 
And swam through dark waters to sirens in the night again 

I was waiting on a fool, I was waiting on a fool 
I was waiting on a fool to change their mind 
They never do 

They never do 

I was waiting on a fool, I was waiting on a fool 
I was waiting on a fool to change their mind 
They never do


THE ORCHARD

Woodman, spare that tree 
Touch not a single bough 
In youth it sheltered me and I'll protect it now 

Rule Britannia, let the wind blow over orchards that never need to dry 
Run the rivers in a straight line over land under a clear blue sky 
The plan was not to die, the plan has been revised 

Woodman, spare that tree 
Touch not a single bough 
In youth it sheltered me, and I'll protect it now 

Call up the mountains to the excavating harvest 
Machines to make a new cemetery of the fruit trees of our youth 
For all the running wild, we just fattened in the sty 
Like Menzies era pride 

[La-la-la] 
They do this when it’s green 
When happens when it’s dry? 

Woodman, spare that tree 
Touch not a single bough 
In youth it sheltered me 
But the orchard’s empty now 

Woodman, spare that tree 
Touch not a single bough 
In youth it sheltered me 
But the orchard’s empty now 
The orchard’s empty now


DOREEN

The city in the distance, and a ripple in the long grass 
An exit from the highway, and a stillness in the sunshine 
A home is like a long dream, there’s room for dreams in Doreen 
And some people dream about making amphetamines 

Doreen, Doreen, Doreen 
Turn around, turn around, Doreen 
Doreen, Doreen, Doreen 
We came here to get clean 
Please, Doreen 

The same sets of conditions that help us take it slowly 
Are also advantageous for speed laboratories 
A fondness for high fences, not too many questions 
Remove all suspicion by waving on occasion 

Doreen, Doreen, Doreen 
Turn around, turn around, Doreen 
Doreen, Doreen, Doreen 
We came here to get clean 
Please, Doreen 

An old drag on a new street, police tape on a crime scene 
A kitchen in a garage, a body beaten savage 
Police would like to speak to two men driving a white ute 
They’re asking round locally for help with inquiries 


Doreen, Doreen, Doreen 
Turn around, turn around, Doreen 
Doreen, Doreen, Doreen 
No more pessimistic scenes 
Please, Doreen 

Police said it had all the hallmarks of some sort of debt 
There’s fixed rate or there’s varied rate or there’s just a kick in the head 
It’s not supposed to be here, crime is a city thing 
I saw it in a movie; the man gives up his life of crime for a girl called 

Doreen, Doreen, Doreen 
Turn around, turn around, Doreen 
Doreen, Doreen, Doreen 
We came here to get clean 
Please, Doreen


MIGHT AS WELL BE THE MOON

This place on a Sunday might as well be the moon 
In outer space there are places less inclined to put you down 
The human race, in its wisdom 
Would sooner send a man into space than see a girl walking around alone here 
For all of the welcome she will find this might as well be the moon 

The window lace, like the red sea, parts wherever your foot will fall 
Those floating eyes in the darkness see everything but the truth 
The sidewalk sighs, you should know now 
They’re making little steps up above us 
There won’t be a television broadcast, but this might as well be the moon 

Without a trace of a footprint you’re just a shadow in a headlight 
In broken glass diamonds after midnight 
With all of these strangers that you know, this might as well be the moon


THE END OF THE AFFAIR

The church bells were ringing, announcing new resolve 
The same bells that told me that the war had been won 
Announcing to the world in their dulcet tones 
The end of the affair 
The end of the affair 

When I grow old I’ll count my money 
In silver coins and little boxes on the ground 
If I have time, I’ll count my lovers 
In silvers frames and yellow pictures of the mind 
The curtain calls, two eyes receding 
Like those above at the end of the affair 

And the church bells were ringing, announcing new resolve 
The same bells that told me that the war had been won 
Announcing to the world in their dulcet tones 
The end of the affair 
The end of the affair 


When we are gone, they’ll play our records 
And hear the sound of little voices that they find 
In place of you, they’ll read your letters 
And speculate on what is lost between the lines 
So long ago, someone was lonely 
Could hardly wait to begin the whole affair 

And the old men were singing in the hotel down the road 
And I found the perfect prayer that seemed to suit the winter mood 
Oh God, you’ve done enough, you’ve robbed me of enough 
Leave me alone forever, leave me alone forever 
At the end of the affair 
The end of the affair
